What would happen if Prohibition should 
finally be made to prohibit? The Drys envisage 
this prospect with the vague exaltation of a 
middle-aged spinster dreaming of her marriage. 
With grim determination they demand enforcement. But beyond enforcement -- what then? 

Have we any reason to hope that if the Prohibition law is once enforced, the country will 
accept the situation and turn its mind to other 
questions? Is there any prospect that "effective" 
Prohibition will solve the liquor problem definitively? The Wets are insincere when they utter 
the objection that "Prohibition does not prohibit"; if it did prohibit they would love it even 
less. The Drys are superficial when they devote 
\[p.18\] 
all their thought to devising measures of enforcement without taking into account the place of 
enforcement in the total social and political life 
of the country. They run the risk of paying for 
success with failure, and of enforcing the law 
only to see it repealed by an exasperated public. 

It is difficult to guess just how much of a reign 
of terror would be necessary in order to bring 
about complete enforcement. Certainly the cost 
would be great, both in money and in strain upon 
the political system. But despite these great 
costs, if the Prohibitionists can maintain their 
voting majority, it is not impossible that they 
may render the law effective. There are in human 
nature a great many cheap or contemptible traits 
which will contribute to their success. If it becomes 
a little dangerous to buy liquor many buyers will 
retire from the market, for the great majority 
of men are lacking in courage; moreover, those who 
do not dare to drink will not care to see others 
enjoy what they are too timid to take, for meanness and envy lurk in most souls; and when those 
\[p.19\] 
who have been frightened out of the market suspect that their neighbors are still buying liquor, 
they will make efforts to verify their suspicions, 
for who is there who is content to mind his own 
business? And when they have verified their suspicions, they will speak disparagingly of their 
neighbor, for hypocrisy is a sin as common as it 
is deplorable. It is fortunate for the Prohibitionists that in the economy of human endeavor noble 
intentions can count on the aid of paltry and 
despicable ones. 

But those who accept the Prohibition regime 
under this kind of pressure will have none of the 
qualities of a crusading army. The spiritual 
strength of the Prohibition movement will not 
increase with its success, but will rather diminish. 
The opponents of Prohibition, on the contrary, 
will find their spiritual strength increased as their 
grievances become more real. 

There will remain many free spirits who, even 
if they conform to the law, will protest the more 
violently against it the more completely they see 
\[p.20\] 
it enforced. Their voices will be only the more 
raucous when their throats are dry. And then,
when the vigilance of the Prohibitionists slackens, 
they will form the nucleus of another mass of systematic violators of the law. Nobody can say 
with any confidence how numerous this remnant 
of the unconverted will be. The straw vote in 
Kansas -- two thousand out of ten thousand ballots cast for repeal -- indicates that this remnant 
can resist a long regime of enforcement. A relatively small number of Wets can serve to keep 
the Prohibitionists *en vedette*, by agitation when 
the law is enforced, and by violation when it is 
not.

So long as Prohibition is taken for granted as 
the pattern for solving the liquor problems, the 
tension of forces cannot reach equilibrium, for the 
winning side does not gather strength, but dissipates it, and the losing side gains cohesion and 
determination from its loss. *For Prohibition creates no stabilizing vested interests irrevocably committed to its perpetuation.* Most reform projects, 
\[p.21\] 
when carried through, anchor themselves quickly 
in new institutions and new systems of rights. An 
agrarian revolution protects itself against reaction 
because the peasants who have taken over the land 
have, each of them, a direct interest in resisting attempts of the expropriated landholders to recover 
their lost rights; a political, democratic revolution tends to protect itself because those who have 
gained the right to vote will not be willing to give 
it up; the emancipation of the slaves resulted in 
the setting up of new political and economic relationships which make the return of slavery in its 
old form impossible. But with Prohibition the 
principal vested interests, definitely and immediately committed to its perpetuation, are precisely those which serve best to keep the question 
in a state of agitation: they are the interests of 
the bootleggers, the professional anti-saloon organizers, the relatives of drunkards, and the personnel of enforcement. And no matter how long 
Prohibition continues to be the regime of the 
country, its institutional equipment will be at the 
\[p.22\] 
end exactly what it was in the beginning, a body 
of officials sniffing for alcohol and armed with the 
right to prosecute under the criminal law. 

When the Wet tells the Dry, "It is none of your 
business what I eat or drink," he is pointing to a 
fact of fundamental importance in the solution of 
the liquor problem (though for reasons which he 
may not intend). He means to imply that the 
Dry regime violates his rights, and this is important from the individual standpoint. From the 
social standpoint the observation is equally significant in another way, for it means that the 
Prohibition regime does not give the Dry any 
rights that will be injured if the Wet drinks 
liquor. Since the Dry does not obtain a vested 
interest that makes it his business what his neighbor eats or drinks, the liquor reform tends to be 
unstable. Men feel that they have an interest in 
the punishment of robbers and murderers, because 
they fear that they may sometime be robbed or 
murdered. But they have not the same kind of 
interest in seeing bootleggers punished, because 
\[p.23\] 
they are not injured by another man's liquor purchase. In the absence of any deeply committed 
interest in the other man's diet, the motive force 
to drive the Prohibition machine must be sought 
elsewhere. 

Contrast, from this standpoint, the liquor question and the question of capital and labor. In 
trying to solve the intricate problems of the relation of employer to employee one can count on 
the existence of stable and well-recognized interests on both sides. The employer does not say to 
the employee, "It's none of your business what 
I pay you," nor does the workman say to the boss, 
"It's none of your business what work I do." But 
the problem of liquor control, when formulated 
as the Prohibition issue, must depend on the unstable forces of humanitarianism, intolerance, 
fanaticism and sentimentality, which live best in 
an atmosphere of perpetual agitation. They are 
powerful forces, as the history of the whole movement shows only too clearly, but they are not 
stabilizing forces unless they can succeed in estab\[p.24\]lishing some institution which will perpetuate 
itself without them. Had the motives in the experiment been less noble they might have been more 
effective. 

There are indeed certain relationships within 
which it does become "the business" of one person 
what the other may eat or drink. Wives accept 
this responsibility towards their husbands and 
children. The food and drink and morale of the 
family are a part of their immediate concern. 
Some parents believe that their children will form 
the most desirable character if they are never exposed to liquor; some wives have drunkard husbands in whose interest they demand that all 
opportunities to drink be closed. These wives and 
parents are the persons in whose names the most 
effective liquor agitation is maintained. No one 
knows just how numerous they are. The spokesmen of certain Prohibitionist organizations sometimes imply that the entire female population of 
the United States lives in fear that every husband 
or child would be a drunkard if given the chance. 
\[p.25\] 
If this were true, there would be a much more 
effective power harnessed to the machinery of 
Prohibition than is now manifest. 

These people who have an immediate personal 
interest in the maintenance of the Dry regime, 
whether they are many or few, are the stuff of 
which irreconcilables are made. Though the success of enforcement will dull the edge of their 
interest, their sense of grievance will become active again as soon as the Wet attitude begins to 
prevail in legislation and administration. There 
are irrepressible Drys just as there are irrepressible Wets. Because of them a victory of the Wets 
would result in no greater stability than a victory 
of the Drys. 

The history of liquor legislation, not only in 
America but in other countries as well, confirms 
the prediction which could be made upon the basis 
of the principles here stated, that when the issue 
of liquor control is formulated as a Prohibition 
issue, the policy of the country will tend to move 
backward and forward between two extremes. 
\[p.26\] 
America passed through one such cycle of Prohibition in the period 1850-1870, and the Scandinavian countries are playing the same game in the 
same way. Is there no issue from this perpetual 
round of agitation? 

It is part of the philosophy of Prohibition that 
the final triumph of the cause, the definitive solution of the liquor question, requires that there 
should come into being an unsullied generation 
which would regard drinking as a moral perversion and the purveyor of liquor as a felon. Until 
this attitude becomes so general that those who 
defend liquor are as rare as those who defend 
murder, forgery or the use of cocaine, liquor legislation will not have passed through the transition 
stage, and we are doomed to continue to swing 
back and forth from one extreme to another. Will 
ironclad enforcement be likely to produce this generation of hardened total abstainers, and will such 
a generation, if it should come to be reared, pass on 
its attitude unchanged to its descendants, like an 
entailed estate? \[p.27\] 

The present enforcement policies, as newly 
drafted by Director Woodcock, even if carried out 
completely, will still be far from the attainment of 
this ultimate objective. The new Director has 
announced his plans to the public: there are to be 
five hundred new agents, daily reports of arrests, 
schools for Prohibition officers, a division of research, a policy of courtesy toward the public, 
restraint in the use of firearms, and a concentration of effort upon big commercial violators. "I 
will not have our agencies following the course of 
least resistance and wasting their time upon pitiful picayunish non-commercial cases. I think the 
Prohibition laws can be successfully enforced 
against commercial violators. I propose to make that our objective, and not to dissipate our energies in other fields." These policies have been 
approved by the Anti-Saloon League and the 
Methodist Board of Temperance and Morals. But 
these are not bone-dry policies. Even if they are 
carried out one hundred per cent, they do not 
bring into being a race of men uncorrupted by 
\[p.28\] 
wine. To get rid of the commercial violator does 
not dispose of drinking, nor of the drinkers, 
appetite. 

Let us assume, nevertheless, that this generation of hardened total abstainers is actually reared 
and that the future is given over to its hands? Can 
we hope that its attitude will be passed unchanged 
from generation to generation like an entailed 
estate? 

The cycle of the generations turns quickly, and 
often it is only necessary for the elders to approve 
of something in order that the youth come to 
disdain it. In Europe, the first generation of the 
nineteenth century despised the French Revolution and all that it had stood for; the next generation adored what its parents abhorred. There is 
today in the young people who are coming of age 
a reaction toward decorum and away from the 
libertinism of the preceding age group which was 
so notoriously demoralized by the war. A generation of total abstainers, if it were produced, would 
not automatically transmit its trait to those who 
\[p.29\] 
would come after it. On the contrary, it would 
be quite likely to see its offspring evince a strange 
curiosity to know liquor as an experience rather 
than as a legend. The Dry regime would have 
enough stability to perpetuate itself only under 
conditions of life -- such as those obtaining on 
farms and in villages -- where the young people are 
under the effective supervision of their elders. The 
trend of American population toward great cities 
is making this situation the exception rather than 
the rule. Consequently we cannot reasonably hope 
that Prohibition, once made effective, would continue without agitation as a permanent and definitive regime. 

A generation brought to maturity without having been given the opportunity to drink will have 
been denied the equally important opportunity 
of refusing to drink. It will harbor no grievance 
against the liquor industry; it will have only the 
vaguest ideas of what must have been meant by the 
saloon evil; it will be slow to participate in the 
belief, in which its parents were indoctrinated, 
\[p.30\] 
that a millennial perfection will pervade society 
when liquor is effectively banned. It will be much 
less rigidly steeled against temptation than were 
the thousands upon thousands of good Methodists 
and Baptists who changed their ideas about wine 
while fighting for democracy in France. It will 
be as easily subject to "demoralization" by exposure to liquor as were the savages to whom the 
traders brought the gift of fire water. 

Nor will it be possible to keep this generation 
of innocents from temptation, no matter how 
effectively we police the cellars of the country. To 
imagine that these young people can be kept in 
complete and blissful ignorance is to forget the 
constantly increasing intercourse between America and the other parts of the world, and to believe that the whole nation can return to the provinciality of thirty years ago. Nearly half a 
million Americans went abroad in 1929; the number increases yearly, and the organization of 
American economy as regards shipping and export trade is dependent upon this mass pilgrim\[p.31\]age. The maintenance of our position in world 
affairs requires a generation of men familiar with 
the world. Our floating universities and travelling fellowships testify that our cultural growth, 
no less than our economic order, demands these 
foreign contacts. We cannot expect these Americans who go abroad to believe that drinking as 
they will know it in Europe is a sin.[^31-1] The more 
effectively they see Prohibition laws enforced in 
America, the more illogical and unsound these 
laws will appear to them. While the prisons are 
converting people to Prohibition, the steamships 
will be converting them to the opposite view. Conversion by foreign travel will be especially frequent among the very class of citizens who are 
most influential. Even a few of them would be 
able to maintain agitation. But they will be many, 
and their voices will be joined with those of the 
\[p.32\] 
unconverted who have remained at home. The 
definitive solution of the liquor question by Prohibition will then require, not only enforcement in 
America, but the imposition of the regime on the 
rest of the world, or the placing of heavy restrictions upon traveling abroad. 

[^31-1]: Note, for example, the new French tourist bargain offered 
under Government auspices to Americans, viz: one hundred 
dollars for a fifteen-day ship to ship tour in France, *including 
wine,* an offer which High Commissioner Gerard seems to have 
evolved with the *arrière pensée* of helping to pry open once 
more the American wine market. 

At this point a permanent Prohibition settlement becomes fantasy. The Communists demand 
that their system be extended to the whole world 
in order that it succeed in one place; the Tokugawa Shogunate sealed up the nation from contact with the rest of the world in order to protect 
it from the dangers of Christianity; the Tsin 
Emperors of China ordered the burning of all 
the books in the realm in order that memory of 
things contrary to their policies should be extinguished. Such measures as these would be required of a Prohibition enforcement policy that 
would permanently protect itself from a relapse, 
or from disturbing agitation. \[p.33\]
