It is the principle of our modest proposal that 
the liquor industry should be made liable for all 
the damage it does, that the uses of liquor which 
create damage should be separated from those 
which are innocent by the simple device of giving 
damaged persons adequate rights to recover 
against responsible defendants. 

We have successfully made use of this principle 
in developing the legal control of many of the 
newer instruments of civilization. It is a natural 
principle to apply whenever a given thing is 
capable of being used either innocently or harmfully. The application of the principle is illustrated in many branches of the law, such as employers' liability, or carriers' liability laws, or 
\[p.154\] 
anti-trust legislation. For reasons which have 
been developed at some length it is a principle 
peculiarly in harmony with our juridical and 
political organization. 

To draw up in full all the details of the proposal at the present moment would be to violate 
one of the objects of the proposal itself, which 
is that the law should grow with experience, and 
should reveal a constant adaptation of means to 
end. This elastic quality of the proposed system 
of liquor law can be illustrated if the history of 
our legal treatment of the automobile is compared 
with the history of liquor legislation. 

### Prohibition vs. Responsibility in Motoring. 

The automobile found its place quickly and 
easily in our social and legislative system. One 
might suppose that since liquor has been with us 
so long, and its dual qualities have been so long 
known to us, it would be acceptably covered by 
appropriate legislation, and that the tensions and 
strains would have been encountered in making a 
\[p.155\] 
place for the automobile. Exactly the reverse was 
the truth, because the wrong legal principles have 
been applied in trying to regulate liquor, the right 
ones in regulating the automobile. 

The automobile and liquor both lend themselves 
either to use or to abuse. Both can be dangerous, 
demoralizing, wasteful of material and human 
energy; and both can be pleasurable and profitable. In both cases a commercial or industrial use 
is sharply distinguished from a recreational use. 
It would be possible in both cases to fix one's 
attention upon the recreational use -- pleasure 
riding or beverage alcohol -- and to concern oneself especially with wrongful or noxious intemperances in uses of this class. 

Liquor control, whether by Moslems or Methodists, gave all its attention to the repression of 
harmful uses of liquor, and did not concern itself 
with the development of innocent uses. That there 
were innocent uses was admitted in both cases. 
The Moslems may read in Verse 216 of the Second Surah of the *Koran*: \[p.156\] 

> "They will ask thee concerning wine and games 
of chance. Say: In both is great sin, and advantage also, but the sin is greater than the advantage. 

The Methodists can read in their Volstead Act 
that liquor is properly to be used for medicinal 
purposes, and the twenty-ninth section of their 
law hints vaguely at innocent drinking of home 
fermented wine. But instead of seeking to substitute good uses for bad ones, Moslem and Methodist alike are willing to impose a dogmatic solution destroying the good uses for the sake of 
getting at the bad ones. In both cases this oversimple remedy has created tensions and raised 
protests which blare at us every day in the newspapers, and which come floating down to us from 
the past ages in the verses of Omar Khayyam. In 
neither case was the regime a complete success. 
The wealthy Moslem in the privacy of his home 
still serves the forbidden wine, justifying himself 
with some careful casuistry. The casuistry of 
drinking under the Prohibition regime in America 
has become as elaborate as the ritual of hospi\[p.157\]tality of which it forms a part. Such procedures 
evidence a faulty juridical situation. But the 
law relating to automobiles developed differently. 
Its primary object was always to make distinctions of degree, protecting the independence of 
the innocent user, and holding the culpable user 
responsible for his acts. 

The automobile was not saved from antipathy 
and persecution by its intrinsic merits. If the 
attempt had been made to kindle fanatical attitudes of antagonism against the motor car, and 
to blame it as the source of vast and vague social 
and personal evils, the case against it could have 
been made as strong as the case against liquor. 
If legislation had been drawn up under the inspiration of such antipathies, and had then become 
fixed as a dogma, a "moral issue," the resulting 
tensions would have been comparable to those 
which the Prohibition laws produce. 

The indictment of liquor could be applied 
count-for-count to the motor car, if only we had 
the desire to do so. The indictment of the saloon 
\[p.158\] 
on religious grounds, which led to the Sunday 
closing laws as the first series of regulatory enactments, is much better found against the motor 
car than against liquor. For the saloon drew from 
church attendance only the men, while Sunday 
joy-riding takes the whole family away from the 
house of God. The case against liquor on moral 
grounds is weak and flimsy compared with the 
case against the automobile. Our standards of sex 
conduct, even in their most severely Puritan form, 
were created and transmitted to us in societies 
which used liquor habitually. It is therefore absurd to say that they are incompatible with the 
use of liquor. Seduction in a saloon, however 
effective as an anecdote to hold the breathless 
attention of the sex-starved Prohibition audience, 
was in fact rare enough to be accounted a good 
incident of melodrama. Seduction in an automobile is too commonplace for melodrama. The 
incident in which the girl is given the option of 
surrendering or walking home is accepted in our 
literature as a mild and standardized joke. Our 
\[p.159\] 
sex morals stood up under centuries of liquor, 
but broke down with two decades of motoring. 

But if we speak of demoralization as something 
more general than the lapsing of female chastity, the case against the automobile becomes even 
stronger. For here one finds the prime agency 
in the demoralization of family life. The survey 
of Middletown showed that most friction between 
parents and children is caused either directly or 
indirectly by the automobile: directly in matters 
connected with the use of the car or the family 
policy of purchasing cars, or of permitting the 
children to own cars; indirectly in the question of 
the participation of the children in a social life 
organized around the use of automobiles. And, 
added to these immediate causes of dispute between parents and children, is the growing independence of the youths and maidens who by the 
mere control of distance can elude parental authority. In the relations of husband and wife it 
appears that the automobile is a disorganizing 
factor. Professor Roland M. Harper of the 
\[p.160\] 
University of Georgia, writing in the *Eugenics 
Magazine* in May, 1930, presented statistics and 
correlations to establish a close connection between automobile-owning and divorce. He said: 

> "Near one extreme at the present time is California, with about one automobile to every three 
persons in 1929, more than one car per family; 
one divorce to every 3.3 marriages, . . . . . . . 
near the other extreme is Georgia with about one 
car or truck in 7.7 persons in 1929 and one divorce 
in every 14 marriages."" 

The kind of statistical method which has been 
applied to the liquor controversy could do marvels 
with such material as this. And facts of common 
knowledge would confirm the view that family 
discipline survived the industrial revolution and 
the factory system, but came to grief when the 
automobile appeared. 

It is the automobile, moreover, which has given 
the criminal a technological advantage over the 
agencies for the suppression of crime. Violence 
and brigandage of a type once to be met with only 
\[p.161\] 
in frontier areas, where the police organization 
of the modern state had not been set up, now comes 
back into the most highly policed cities. The 
criminal can count on getting away from the scene 
of the crime so quickly that pursuit is vain. The 
murderer can be across two state lines before his 
victim's body is cold. The police authorities are 
helpless with their local jurisdictions and their 
limited responsibilities inherited from a time when 
criminals were run down with the hue and cry. The 
police organization availed easily to apprehend 
criminals whose offenses were due to liquor. But 
the modern criminal works when he is sober and 
uses a high-powered car. The decades of the 
twentieth century which saw the simultaneous 
advance of Prohibition and the automotive industry saw not only an increase in criminal activity, 
but also an increase in the elusiveness of criminals. 
Liquor crime was never as much of an evil as 
automobile crime. 

The demoralization which is the characteristic 
quality of automotive civilization is manifested 
\[p.162\] 
not only in the moral but also in the economic 
sphere. For the automobile has notoriously and 
continuously caused people to make expenditures 
they could not afford. The sacrifice of more substantial things for the sake of an automobile has 
been a scandal ever since the marketing of machines on the installment plan was begun. This 
is more serious than the unwise expenditure fostered by liquor because the amount is larger, 
and the mortgage on the future more oppressive. 
And when there comes into the reckoning the use 
of the car as a mere index of rank in the community, for the value of the prestige it gives, the 
wastage is so excessive as to dwarf by comparison 
the losses that used to be charged to drinking, 
when one maintained his prestige by "treating" 
his companions. The wastefulness of automobiles 
is great enough from the personal standpoint; 
from the social point of view it is scandalously 
prodigal. The junking of cars that are not half 
used up, and the making of cars that are to be 
used to answer a fashion need rather than a trans\[p.163\]portation need are intolerable practices that none 
but a spendthrift society would permit. The drain 
is made not only upon the energies of labor and 
capital, but what is more important, upon the 
irreplaceable natural resources of the country. 
The liquor industry used only the products of 
the soil, perennially replaceable, but the automotive industry is gutting the continent of oil 
coal, and metals at a rate which our posterity 
will not condone. 

There is certainly an economically justified 
commercial use of automotive transportation, 
which critics of the automobile should take into 
account, just as critics of liquor take into account 
the commercial and industrial uses of alcohol. 
The wasteful public is the joy-riding public. But 
the joy-rider gets no true pleasure from his ride, 
any more than he gets pure air from his outing. 
Auto-riding is to walking as wine is to water; 
it exhilarates only those whose natural healthful 
tastes are spoiled. The fresh air which is thought 
to be within the reach of the motorist reeks with 
\[p.164\] 
carbon monoxide. To get really fresh air one 
must walk far from the highways. But with the 
decrease of walking, and the disappearance of 
footpaths, there are no longer any places for 
pedestrians except the perilous and poisonous 
edges of the highways. Thus the automobile has 
taken away our birthright of health. For 
automobile-driving is not only intoxicating; it is 
also habit-forming, and the habit spreads so rapidly and takes hold so firmly that millions of men, 
once normal healthy human beings, are now so 
circumstanced that they will never walk for 
pleasure again. 

It is impossible to calculate the exact extent of 
the damage to health ascribable to the automobile, but that small proportion of the damage 
which can be established statistically is already 
appalling. This is the death rate from automobile 
accidents. Whereas alcoholism accounted for a 
death rate of six per one hundred thousand in 
1900, and accounts for four today, the death rate 
from automobile accidents stands at twenty, and 
\[p.165\] 
is steadily rising. An American is five times as 
likely to be killed in an auto accident as to die 
of alcoholism. But the death rate from accidents 
tells only part of the story, for there are countless injuries, more or less serious, and more or 
less permanent, taking their toll of human happiness every day. 

This indictment of the automobile uses no new 
nor unfamiliar material. The most important 
counts are already widely discussed. But they 
are never brought together to make a case for 
the prohibition of automobiles. There was a time, 
early in the history of the industry, when widespread public antipathy to the motor car was 
manifest. Juries were merciless; speed laws were 
oppressive and ill adapted to the mechanical needs 
of automobile operation. The expression "joyriding" threatened to take on a meaning conveying reproach. Many a teamster cursed the horseless carriage with a full heart. The farmer whose 
chickens were run over boiled with rage. But this 
attitude of hostility died down rapidly because 
\[p.166\] 
the automobile paid its way, the law was intelligently developed to discourage abuses but to encourage rightful use of the new invention, and a 
large automobile-owning public appeared. A way 
was found to maintain *responsible driving*. 

The importance of identifying car and driver 
in order that responsibility for damage might be 
fixed led early to the visible license plate. For 
a long time it was assumed that anyone who owned 
a car was likely to be wealthy enough to pay compensation for any damage he might do, but when 
this ceased to be true, legislatures began to study 
projects for compulsory public liability insurance. 
Since the automobile owners were using the roads 
heavily, and demanding more and better roads, 
taxation was devised by which they could pay for 
what they wanted. As the increased weight of 
traffic on the roads and the improved condition 
of the roads created serious traffic problems, these 
were studied without prejudice. The old principle that safe driving was necessarily slow driving was discarded, and it was found that on certain 
\[p.167\] 
highways the slow driver, not the fast one, was the 
dangerous man. The common sense distinction 
between the careful driver and the negligent one 
had received all along its due legal recognition; 
the former was protected and the latter mercilessly subjected to civil and criminal penalties. 
The system of licensing drivers was introduced 
in order that persons unable to drive safely might 
be kept off the roads. Systems of car inspection 
are now being worked out which will diminish the 
risk of accidents due to bad mechanical conditions 
in a car. The technique of traffic control is being 
mechanized and standardized, traffic signals are 
becoming better known, and the relative rights of 
those who wish to park their cars beside the road 
and those who wish to keep a broad highway clear 
are being adjusted on principles of maximum 
social good. Legislation keeps in touch with enforcement possibilities, and both are in harmony 
with the system of civil-law liability. The driver 
who has no accident and violates no traffic rule is 
never asked about his driver's license. The man
\[p.168\] 
who suffers damage while driving on the wrong 
side of the road prejudices his right to collect 
compensation. The most serious criminal offense 
is the failure to stop after an accident, for the 
hit-and-run driver is escaping from civil liability 
for his conduct. There is constant experiment 
with automobile regulation; public opinion provides a continuous flood of criticism; the law never 
becomes committed blindly to a dogma. This 
branch of our law is a living and growing thing 
which adapts itself to its environment; the liquor 
law, on the contrary, is dead. 

### The Principles of a Living System of Liquor Law.
 
A living system of liquor law could grow from 
very modest beginnings. As in the case of the 
automotive industry, the attempt might be made 
to make the industry pay its way. This attempt, 
consistently followed, would lead to the evolution 
of a whole system of law, a few elements of which 
it will be possible to suggest by way of prophecy. 
There is no need for a special and exceptional 
\[p.169\] 
theory of liquor control; it is necessary rather 
to cease thinking of liquor as a special and exceptional subject, and to make a thoroughly competent attempt to apply to liquor the principles 
of human relationship which are found throughout our legal system. 

To be subject to abuse as well as to innocent 
use is so common to material things that the 
peculiar problems of liquor control do not derive 
from this aspect of the nature of liquor. The 
peculiarity about liquor is rather that the damage 
which results from its abuse is not easily indemnified. The man who uses liquor to the harm of 
another person is often unable to make good the 
damage. If the injury is done to a member of 
his family, then it is impossible for him to make 
amends by paying for the damage, for that is only 
robbing Peter to pay Paul. Sometimes the essence 
of the grievance is poverty induced by drunkenness, in which case no indemnity can be found so 
long as there is only the pauper to pay it. Therefore, just as recourse in industrial accidents has 
\[p.170\] 
been shifted from the "fellow servant" who actually causes the accident to the employer who 
is actually innocent, so in liquor law, recourse for 
damage done must be shifted from the drinker 
to the dealer in liquor. 

To shift the incidence of liability from drinker 
to dealer is the first step in applying ordinary 
principles of civil justice to the problem of liquor 
control. It is necessary, of course, to make sure 
that the dealer will be solvent, and able to indemnify any damage done by his liquor. And 
beyond that a special type of control is demanded, 
comparable to the licensing of automobiles and 
drivers. For it will be necessary to establish such 
a definite connection between a particular drinker 
and a particular dealer that the procedure of finding the dealer responsible for any item of damage 
will be simple and direct. 

If we, then, pick up the old civil-damage laws 
where they were left by public indifference a generation ago, the next step in their development is 
marked out for us. The liability placed upon the 
\[p.171\] 
seller must be made effective. As to how it can be 
made effective, the history of the automobile industry suggests the end, and the organization of 
the liquor business under the Volstead Act foreshadows the means. 

In the history of our civilization the theme is 
recurrent that a doomed institution, in fulfilling 
the conditions of its own inner development, prepares for the new institution which will take its 
place. Feudal society created the condition which 
made democracy possible, just as tribal society 
had created the conditions that made feudalism 
possible. The ponderous trend of history seems 
to move toward its destiny with complete contempt 
for our shouting and explaining and theorizing. 
The First French Republic, while sputtering its 
hatred of monarchs, carried France forward in 
the thoroughly monarchical policies of internal 
centralization and foreign expansion for which the 
monarchs themselves had striven. One of the 
greatest of modern economic historians[^171-1] believes 
\[p.172\] 
that negro slavery in the South would have developed naturally, without the intervention of violent 
abolitionist action, into the same system of semi-serfdom by negro renters, share-farmers and farm 
laborers in which the contemporary South has 
brought its agrarian economy to equilibrium. The 
movements of industrial expansion, consolidation 
and super-organization which are directed in 
America from Wall Street, in Russia from the 
Kremlin, shout out against each other as if they 
were mortal enemies. The time may come when 
we will regard them as two examples of the same 
trend which worked out their common destiny together, regardless of the system of names by which 
men chose to call them. 

[^171-1]: Max Weber. 

The development of the liquor industry under 
the Prohibition regime assumes from this standpoint a curious aspect. It seems to have been 
preparing itself for control by civil-damage actions, even while the shouting on both sides ignored the civil-damage principle entirely. The 
legal and illegal branches of the liquor industry 
\[p.173\] 
developed parallel systems of registration and 
control, tightening the nexus between buyer and 
seller. The lawful dealer in liquor made his register of sales and customers in compliance with the 
Volstead Act; the illicit dealer kept his list and 
scrutinized his customers carefully to avoid undercover agents. The lawful purchaser got a permit 
or a doctor's prescription; the illicit buyer had a 
bootlegger's card. *The net result in both cases 
was to set up the very type of machinery of administration which the principle of civil damage, 
developing without the interference of Prohibition 
agitation would have been required to create.* 
Perhaps there is a subtle destiny which, in ruling 
that the clear definition of rights must precede their 
effective protection, mocks the plans of Wets and 
Drys alike. 

### The Drinkers' Registration and the Dealer's Bond. 

A system of responsible drinking could begin 
with the equipment already in existence: the civil-damage laws on the statute books, the arrange\[p.174\]ment for the bonding and for the guaranteed 
financial responsibility of liquor dealers under the 
revenue laws, and the registration devices worked 
out under the permissive section of the Volstead 
Act and in the informal folkways which govern 
the relation of bootleggers and patrons. These 
elements need not be invented; they require only 
to be combined and standardized in a registration 
system with the double object of making possible 
the tracing of any liquor damage to some definite 
dealer, and assuring the ability of the dealer to 
pay for the damage caused. 

Liquor registration cards would be issued ordinarily to any adult. Under the present system 
a man who wants liquor gets a special kind of 
permit or introduction for every type of use. For 
manufacturing, a permit from the Prohibition 
administrator, for medicine, a prescription from a 
physician, for drinking at a party, an introduction 
to a good bootlegger. The procedure in establishing relations with a bootlegger is not standardized, and is usually quite as simple as the proce\[p.175\]dure in establishing relations with a bank. One 
receives a number or a signed card or has his name 
entered in a book. The procedure under the 
Prohibition administration on the contrary is quite 
complex. The following rules are quoted from 
Page 69 of Treasury Department Regulations 
No. 3, issue of 1927: 

> If the application is approved by the administrator he will endorse his approval on three copies of 
form 1447 and before issuance of permit, will forward such copies, with reports of investigating officers, all supporting documentary evidence submitted 
with the application and the duplicate bond, to the 
commissioner, except in case of renewal of permits 
now outstanding. The fourth copy of Form 1447 
will be retained by the administrator to be used for 
preparing verified copy for transportation purposes. ... 

(The purchaser is still a long way from having 
his alcohol even when he has the verified copy of 
Form 1447.) 

The effect of standardizing registrations would 
be to increase somewhat the formality of the regis\[p.176\]tration of the beverage purchaser, and to simplify 
some of the rigmarole which the purchaser for 
other purposes must go through. The issuing of 
cards and registering of names, instead of being 
divided between bootleggers and government officials, would be concentrated in the hands of the 
officials. 

The prospective purchasers of beverage liquor, 
in accordance with established customs, would 
naturally get themselves introduced to liquor 
dealers. The liquor dealers would be hesitant to 
sell to strangers, for reasons which will presently 
appear. 

The dealers, on their part, would also combine 
the two present systems of organization and discipline into one. There is at present one class of 
liquor dealers heavily bonded, registered by the 
government, and kept in line by the threat of revocation of license. The other class of dealers, 
especially in the cities, participate in an underground organization which is more highly disciplined in some respects than legitimate industry. 
\[p.177\] 
The penalties for disregard of the rules are often 
more severe in the illicit organization than in the 
legal one. The non-conforming bootlegger may 
lose his protection and go to jail, or he may be 
"taken for a ride." A unified registration system covering both the industrial and beverage industries, and under the control of the government, 
would divert to more socially useful channels the 
sums now paid for racketeering and graft. 

Then these two registration systems, of dealers 
on the one hand and drinkers on the other, must 
be coordinated. Two devices for coordination 
suggest themselves. One of them resembles the 
method used in controlling the retailing of poisons: 
every purchase must be recorded and signed for in 
the dealer's register. This is the system used in 
the industrial alcohol business under the Volstead 
Act. The other device resembles the method used 
in banking operations: each drinker has a definitely established connection with a dealer who 
knows and trusts him. The mutual confidence developed between bootlegger and drinker, in which 
\[p.178\] 
the seller trusts the customer not to betray him, 
and the buyer trusts the bootlegger not to poison 
him, resembles somewhat the relationship of confidence necessary in financial operations. Whether 
the coordination of the registration of purchaser 
and dealer is to be patterned on the example of 
the legitimate or illicit trade is of no consequence, 
provided the end is obtained that for every liquor 
purchase there is some definitely responsible and 
solvent sponsor able to pay for all the damage the 
liquor may do, and provided that the procedure 
for establishing this responsibility be simple and 
direct. 

The categories of damage for which the liquor 
dealers will be held liable can begin with those 
which are set forth in the existing civil-damage 
laws. They might properly be extended to cover 
damages in the moral and psychological category. 
The statutory rates of damage should be high 
enough to render the actual pursuit of the rights 
of aggrieved parties a practicable and even a profitable undertaking, and to make the avoidance of 
\[p.179\] 
damage suits the first endeavor of the liquor 
dealer. The most prosperous dealer would be the 
one who had the fewest claims against him; it would 
hardly be a sound business policy for him to take 
money from men whose families were suffering for 
lack of it, or to sell liquor to a person likely to get 
drunk, or to sell to minors. A good method for 
working out the categories of damage would be 
the following: take a package of propaganda 
literature of the Anti-Saloon League and an 
equal package of the literature of the Association 
Against the Prohibition Amendment. Make from 
the Anti-Saloon League literature a list of all the 
types of damage alleged to be caused to innocent 
parties by drinking in the saloon, and from the 
other literature a list of all the types of damage 
which are said to result directly from drinking 
under Prohibition. These two lists would be the 
basis of the statutory schedule of indemnification. 
To keep the law nicely adjusted to its purpose, 
both as to matters of substance and matters of 
procedure, would be a problem requiring constant 
\[p.180\] 
study and experiment. The result would be a 
healthy growth of a sound legislation which would 
not only conform to the convictions of the mass of 
the people, but would create vested interests committed to its perpetuation and development. 

There would certainly spring up a whole race of 
rascals who would endeavor by various frauds and 
wiles to create fictitious rights of action against 
liquor dealers, just as accident sharks make money 
by suing traction companies. The liquor-dealers 
would protect themselves against these tricksters 
in exactly the same way that speakeasies protect 
themselves against prohibition agents, or grocers 
against bad credit accounts. Such a situation 
might render it as hard for a stranger in a town 
to buy liquor as it is for him now to cash a check. 
The situation would, in this respect, be a new 
adaptation of the one with which we are already 
familiar: that scoundrels assist in the enforcement 
of the law. The activities of these "confidence" 
men would render the running of the old-fashioned 
open-house saloon both risky and unprofitable. \[p.181\] 

The inconvenience resulting from the registration requirements would sit lightly upon people 
who were in their own communities, but would become galling to the traveler. The principles of 
the modest proposal indicate, however, that anyone willing and able to pay all the costs that may 
result from his conduct should be permitted to 
assume the risks of his drinking, and to relieve 
the dealer of liability. The method used might 
well be the posting of a bond to cover the dealer 
for all costs arising under the civil-damage laws. 
A certificate not unlike a letter of credit could be 
issued upon this bond, increasing the drinking 
freedom of those who were able to pay for it. This 
is a perfectly logical element of the plan, because 
the only reason for shifting the incidence of the 
liability from drinker to dealer was the imputed 
inability of the drinker to pay. The regime would 
thus prolong indefinitely into the future the advantages in drinking which wealth confers at 
present. The difference would be that whereas 
under the present system wealth enables a man 
\[p.182\] 
more effectively to evade the law, in the future it 
would enable him more effectively to comply with 
it. 

The problem of enforcement under these conditions would be primarily the problem presented 
when some damage recognized as such in the statutory schedule should result from drinking, and 
yet there should be no way of tracing the damage 
to its source. The logic of the system would require that even in such a case the injured parties 
should be indemnified, possibly at the charge of a 
fund maintained by the whole liquor industry. 
But such cases of untraceable damage could not 
occur except where there had been an evasion of 
the registration laws. And such evasions would be 
penalized, whether drinker or dealer were the 
guilty party. 

Certainly there will be bootleggers and blind 
pigs just as there were in the old days of the 
licensed saloon, and just as there are under Prohibition. But they will be more easily dealt with 
than they were in the old days because of the 
\[p.183\] 
double segregation of legitimate from illegitimate 
drinker as well as legitimate from illegitimate 
dealer. Public opinion will defend neither the 
drinking rights of those who cannot drink responsibly, nor the selling rights of those who seek to 
evade ordinary civil liability for damage. The 
energies of the police will be focussed upon that 
part of the drink problem which really requires 
police attention, namely, the noxious conduct of 
the intemperate drinker and the irresponsible 
dealer. 

The profit in bootlegging will be ruinously reduced. The responsible and legitimate dealer, with 
his register of patrons, his sales book and his bond 
for the satisfaction of claims against him, will 
have the most profitable and valuable trade. And 
if irresponsible retailers spring up to peddle liquor 
to people whom no responsible dealer would trust 
with it, their course will be more difficult than that 
which lies before the present day bootlegger. They 
will have no rich clientele. If any of their patrons 
become drunk or cause damage, they are likely to 
\[p.184\] 
be discovered and punished. The wholesalers will 
not only refuse them supplies, but will try to run 
them out of business because every damage claim 
which arises out of unregistered drinking will be 
levied upon the industry as a whole. Not only will 
they lack the support of public opinion, but they 
will have no access to "important money," and no 
cooperation from the large-scale industry. 

### "Enforcement" and Possible Development toward Limited Prohibition. 

It is at this point that the police power enters 
the scene. It gives its aid to the maintenance of 
discipline in the liquor industry, and serves the 
most wealthy branch of the industry, as at present. But it will be acting within the law rather 
than contrary to it. The unregistered and illicit 
dealer would occupy in the trade the uncomfortable position of a speakeasy proprietor who has 
not seen the right people or paid the right protection. 

The enforcement of the registration of drinkers 
\[p.185\] 
would resemble the enforcement of the laws requiring drivers' licences. There would be no prowling 
breath-smellers asking people to show their 
papers. But if something should happen calling 
for police protection, and liquor should be involved in any way, the normal thing would be to 
ask for the display of one's drinking license. 
When the neighbors call the police to quiet a 
party, or when there is an accident on the street 
and someone involved has liquor on his breath, or 
a complaint comes into headquarters about disorderly conduct, then the drinker who has not registered will find himself in trouble. If a drinker 
should be unregistered for the whole length of his 
life, but should never cause any harm to any other 
person by his drinking, nor become involved in 
any incident of disorder, the evasion of the registration law would not defeat the general purpose 
of liquor regulation. The total abstainer would 
not need to trouble himself about the regime; the 
moderate drinker would prudently provide himself 
with a card as a protection against annoyance if 
\[p.186\] 
occasion should arise for its production. The 
toper would find the regime an inconvenience, just 
as the reckless driver regrets the existence of the 
driving license system. 

Police interference to prevent unregistered 
drinking would be in the background of the liquor 
policy; the pressure of ordinary business interest 
would be in the foreground. This is the same 
kind of restraint that makes it difficult for the 
man without money in the bank to cash a check. 
The police stand ready to arrest him for forgery 
if he succeeds in cashing it. This may be an effective deterrent. But even more effective is the unwillingness of people with money to advance it in 
large amounts to unknown persons upon a personal check. A stranger to our civilization who 
should see someone make a purchase and sign a 
check for it might wonder how restrictions could 
be invented to keep anyone from signing and negotiating checks of any amount whatsoever. The 
forger's ability to cash a check is limited primarily 
by the financial and economic system and only in 
\[p.187\] 
the second place by the activities of the police. So 
also the most effective limitation upon the purchase of liquor by drunkards would be the establishment of a system which made it profitable to 
sell to moderate drinkers, and costly to sell to 
drunkards. Toward the creation of such a system the civil-damage laws point the way. 

If, then, at some future time it should be desired to introduce the principle of direct police 
supervision over the conduct of drunkards, the 
drinker's register would serve as a starting point 
for such an enterprise. The revocation of permits could be imposed as a consequence of misuse 
of liquor. The distinction could then be made systematically in criminal law between noxious and 
innocent uses of liquor, and between the moderate 
drinker and the toper. Such a police regime would 
tend to develop toward Prohibition for some persons, but not for all. 

The principle that the government may discriminate between its citizens, extending to some 
civil rights which it denies to others, is already 
\[p.188\] 
practiced in many departments of political life. 
The permission to carry firearms is regularly controlled by the State in such a way as to deny 
permits to those who, in the opinion of the authorities, would make wrongful use of their weapons. 
The regime governing the issue of automobile and 
aeroplane operators' licenses is intended to protect the public from unskilful drivers. The only 
objections to the extension of this principle are 
administrative difficulties, not political principles. 

If the State possessed the administrative machinery to carry its desires into effect, there is almost no limit to the use that might be made of the 
principle of the legal distinction between the qualified and unqualified person. The censorship problem would disappear if it were possible to give 
prospective readers a purity test. A man who 
wanted to read *Candide* or *The Decameron* would 
have only to provide himself with the necessary 
credentials. This regime is already in existence 
with respect to certain classes of books sold only 
to doctors and lawyers. There are some who argue 
\[p.189\] 
that intelligence tests, aptitude tests, and perhaps sanity tests should be more generally given, 
so that it would be possible for the average citizen 
to prove by documentary evidence his intelligence 
or sanity. Certainly the capacity test for drinkers would be a useful addition to the list of legally 
established inequalities before the law. And the 
system of responsible drinking would in fact operate as a capacity test, which could be utilized for 
police purposes. The system of responsible drinking is not essentially police-controlled except in its 
registration features, but it offers the prospect of 
developing the basis of a reasonable type of police 
control if the evolution of the legal system should 
come to require it. 

If the development of direct police intervention 
in drinking should happen to take the road toward 
partial Prohibition, it would find the traces of 
earlier legislation along the way. For the liquor 
regulation policies of colonial times, insofar as 
they concerned themselves with the problem of 
drunkenness, were invariably based upon distinc\[p.190\]tions of persons. In colonial Boston it was against 
the law for the innkeeper to sell to a toper, and 
for the toper to buy. Prohibition against the sale 
to Indians, one of the few relics of the older type 
of legislation that has survived, was a common 
regulation in colonial times, and is still a Federal 
law. Prohibitions were also directed against the 
buying of liquor by apprentices or slaves without 
the permission of the master. This type of prohibitory law was undermined in the movement toward 
equality of rights of which Jacksonian Democracy 
marks one crisis, and the Emancipation Proclamation another. The present intent of some of the 
nullifiers of the Prohibition law, and the probable 
intent of some of the voters and legislators who 
passed it, was to reproduce a control of this type. 
There is a difference, however, between restrictions 
based on class distinctions and restriction based on 
individual qualification. Responsible drinking, if 
it ultimately develops into a type of limited Prohibition, will be more consistent with equalitarian 
ideals than were the old laws against liquor-pur\[p.191\]chase by apprentices, indentured laborers and 
slaves. 

Any liquor regime, Wet or Dry, which makes no 
distinction between competent and incompetent 
drinkers creates a legitimate grievance in one or 
another element of the population. The grievances 
so created are sufficiently important to account for 
the instability of Wet and Dry regimes alike. Prohibition wrongs those who know how to use liquor 
without abusing it, while anti-Prohibition, as at 
present proposed, wrongs those who suffer from the 
abuse of liquor. If everyone were temperate in the 
use of liquor, or if everyone injured his fellowmen 
by over-indulgence whenever given the chance, 
there would be an underlying rationality in the 
Wet and Dry regime which would sooner or later 
win general consent. The principle that men as 
drinkers are equal is as baneful a fiction as the notion that liquor can be "intoxicating" in itself, 
regardless of its use. is the 
first step in making the distinction between men as 
drinkers. It is most easily conceived as a system 
\[p.192\] 
of law which depends primarily upon litigation for 
enforcement. And if there ensues a utilization 
of police power for the further protection of rights 
which litigation will have defined, then liquor control will be but following the beaten path marked 
out by the normal growth of every branch of jurisprudence. 

### The Hope of Ending Controversy. 

If as a system of liquor 
control is to commend itself to the sound sense of 
the country, it must offer the prospect of quieting 
agitation on both sides, and of leaving the people 
free to devote their constructive political energies 
to more important matters. To accomplish this 
necessary stabilization, it must promise so effectively to put an end to grievances that the conscience of the country will accept its results. The 
psychic energy which is now given so prodigally 
to the campaign for and against Prohibition must 
be diverted to a more constructive channel, where 
well intentioned efforts will accomplish positive re\[p.193\]suits, and give rise not merely to countervailing 
movements, so that the two forces cancel each other. 

What are the existing grievances on both sides 
of the liquor question? They are divided into two 
classes: those arising from suffering directly experienced under the Dry regime on one hand or because of the saloon on the other and, second, those 
inflated grievances which are developed by both 
sides as part of the technique of political agitation, 
and which are magnified by the method of tracing 
indirect causal sequences. By making use of this 
method the most extravagantly evil consequences 
can be attributed to liquor on the one hand, and 
to Prohibition on the other. 

Just as the Anti-Saloon League used to hold 
the saloon responsible every time a girl "went 
wrong," or a man deserted his family, or a family 
was reduced to poverty, or a boy went to jail, so 
now the Wets try to hold Prohibition responsible 
for these same things. The Wets declare that 
Prohibition is the cause of the crime wave and of 
racketeering, just as the Drys used to declare that 
\[p.194\] 
the saloon was the cause of crime and political 
corruption. Both types of complaint involve exaggerations which deprive them of all but propagandist value. 

As typical illustrations of this tracing of indirect consequences it is worth analyzing two of 
the principal arguments of this type, one of the 
Wets, the other of the Drys. 

The Wets claim that Prohibition has increased 
criminality. This is true, of course, to the extent 
that a new class of crimes has been created. But 
the idea that a general contempt for government 
and law has resulted from the Prohibition enforcement situation is an error in reading the thought 
of the people. There has already been occasion 
to explain (in Chapter III) the fact that people 
do not transfer their attitude toward Prohibition 
to other laws; they distinguish very consciously 
between the laws they respect and those they ignore. The racketeering technique, conspicuous 
as a means of discipline in the illicit liquor trade, 
actually evolved in the building trades before Pro\[p.195\]hibition, and extends itself today to fields totally 
unconnected with liquor. Political corruption in 
the last few years has smelt at least as strongly of 
oil as of alcohol. 

A typical prohibitionist "long-range" argument 
runs to the effect that liquor is incompatible with 
the Machine Age. This dictum has the same dogmatic appeal that attaches to Mr. McBride's view 
that Prohibition expresses the Divine Will. It is 
impossible to prove and difficult to test. But such 
tests as we have available throw doubt upon it. 
With respect to the relation of liquor and industrialization we have what we call a "control," 
namely, certain highly industrialized countries 
which permit liquor. The large scale economic 
phenomena, such as business cycles, trends toward 
consolidation, variations in price level, displacement of hand labor by machinery, or the phenomenon of over-production, manifest themselves in 
the different countries of the world without any 
notable correlation between prosperity and liquor 
regime. \[p.196\] 

In America itself, the areas which are most definitely committed to Prohibition, and in which 
the Prohibition regime has come to be most effective, are the very areas which are least touched by 
industrialization, namely the countryside and the 
small towns. The 1918 Wet-Dry map indicates 
clearly that the most highly industrialized areas 
were precisely the ones least willing to ban liquor. 
If industrialization compel Prohibition as its necessary consequence, and the liquor industry were a 
correlate of rural life, then we should expect to see 
the great urban industrial centers forcing Prohibition upon a reluctant and rebellious area of 
farms and villages as excise taxation was forced 
upon the mountaineers, or the industrial tariff on 
the middle western farmers. Henry Ford declares 
that the manufacture of automobiles is incompatible with a liquor regime, and Anti-Saloon League 
literature argues that the use of automobiles means 
Prohibition as its inevitable corollary. But actually Ford's foreign factories function without the 
aid of Prohibition, and the center of the automo\[p.197\]bile trade is so far from being Dry at the present 
time that the Supreme Court, in *Carrol & Kiro vs. 
U. S.* (267 U. S. 132) took judicial notice of the 
fact that Detroit is "one of the most active centers 
of the illicit liquor trade," and the U. S. Circuit 
Court in a Detroit insurance case (*Lula Anders* v. 
*Title Guaranty and Casualty Co.*) ruled that a 
speakeasy is not a place of peril, and took judicial 
notice that "prohibition in law is not prohibition in 
fact" and that liquor is served "not only in blind 
pigs and kindred establishments, but that it is also 
at times illegally possessed, served and consumed 
in almost every sort of place where human beings 
foregather in the large cities of this country, with 
the exception possibly of religious edifices, court 
rooms, cemeteries, school-rooms, prisons, reformatories and W. C. T. U. headquarters." 

These arguments, intended to establish the indirect evils of the saloon or of Prohibition, belong 
at the present state of our knowledge to the 
domain of rhetoric rather than to the domain of 
science. They contain an intrinsic fallacy which 
\[p.198\] 
in social thinking is the mark of the crank and 
the agitator. They assume that there is only 
one significant variable in the total social and economic situation, and that all changes can be referred back to that variable. Of course, the fact 
is that organized society shows a multiplicity of 
variables and a reciprocity of causes and effects. 
For this very reason the crank can always establish a connection between his own little pet cause 
and a great budget of vast effects. The same thing 
will be treated by one agitator as a cause, by another as an effect. The Prohibitionist says abuse 
of liquor causes poverty; the socialist says poverty 
causes the abuse of liquor. Both are right. One 
reformer will ascribe all significant evils to capitalism, another will attribute them to irreligion, 
another will maintain that they result from immigration, others will blame them upon defects of 
the educational system. It is because the forces 
at play in society are so infinitely interrelated that 
cranks are able to make out plausible cases for the 
wide ramification of some particular evil which 
\[p.199\] 
seems to them of transcendent importance. 

But when they come to evaluate results of their 
pet reform, they forget the complexity of this 
interrelation of forces in society. The prohibitionist argument that prosperity is due to Prohibition carries to the limit of absurdity this 
ridiculous parody of science. Speculation as to 
the indirect grievances arising out of Prohibition, 
or resulting from the liquor traffic, is not sufficiently well grounded in exact information to 
make it worthy of consideration as a basis for 
sound statesmanship. 

But with direct damages it is otherwise. No 
speculative theses are required to prove that the 
man who is in jail on a Prohibition conviction is 
a criminal because of Prohibition; no far-fetched 
analogies or strained statistics are needed to demonstrate that the man who wants good liquor, and 
gets poisoned liquor, bad liquor, or no liquor, is 
directly affected by the Dry regime. No devious 
chains of causation need be traced in order to 
show that a wife whose husband is squandering 
\[p.200\] 
in a saloon the money needed by his family (and 
any individuals injured in comparable ways) has 
a direct and legitimate grievance against the liquor 
industry. If we can contrive a regime which will 
allay these direct, individual grievances against 
Prohibition on one hand and the saloon on the 
other, the indirect and speculative grievances 
would probably be insufficient to maintain a political cause. 

It is a peculiarity of the Prohibition regime that 
it seems to be concerned much more definitely with 
the indirect than with the direct grievances arising from the liquor problem. 

What can the regime offer to meet the complaints of the moderate drinker? It can only 
express the hope that it can educate him toward 
total abstinence. If it could so educate him, the 
grievance would disappear. But the argument 
against moderate drinking cannot make its way 
against the resistance offered. The attempt is 
made to prove that moderate drinking is harmful 
to the drinker, but it is impossible to make out a 
\[p.201\] 
conclusive case to this end except by ignoring the 
aesthetic side of life. There is also cited the exhortation to self-sacrifice according to the teaching of St. Paul that "if meat causeth my brother 
to offend I will eat no flesh while the world 
standeth lest it cause my brother to offend." But 
there is not enough of the saintly spirit in America 
to make the benevolent program of St. Paul a 
practicable one. The argument that total abstinence is imposed by the Machine Age, and not by 
the whim of faction or party, is ineffective, because 
the Machine Age itself delivers its verdict ambiguously. It puts its slaves to a nervous strain 
which, for all we know, may create an urgent need 
for strong stimulants, artificiality in the environment calling for artificiality in the diet. It may 
be that this nervous strain, which the bucolic 
peasants do not know, accounts for the stubborn 
resistance which liquor offers to the efforts made 
to eradicate it from the cities, where the seal of 
the Machine is most definitely set upon life. 
Neither the argument for self-interest, nor the 
\[p.202\] 
argument for charity, nor the argument of inevitability can be quite conclusively made out. But 
as long as the moderate drinker remains unpersuaded, his grievance will persist, and the Prohibition regime will rest upon the principle of constraint, lacking the free consent of those whose 
conduct it modifies. 

If the direct grievances of the moderate drinker 
remain outstanding under Prohibition, what is 
to be said of the direct complaints of those who are 
injured by the liquor industry? An example of 
the kind of satisfaction which the sufferers from 
liquor get under Prohibition is given in a monograph published by Prohibition Commissioner 
Doran on June 1, 1930, explaining the difficulties 
of enforcement in cities. It appears from his 
statement that in New York "there come to the 
Prohibition administrator's office daily many complaints made by citizens of liquor-law violations 
and the resulting nuisances . . . they are investigated by the Federal investigators as rapidly as 
possible. There are only eight investigators in 
\[p.203\] 
the local office, and much of their time is spent on 
the larger phases of the work." The following is 
a sample of the letters sent to the Prohibition Administrator: 

> Dec. 28, 1929. 

> Dear Sir: 

> I am notifying you of a place at [address withheld], between Second and Third avenue. The 
name of the owner is ......; he also has a partner, 
but I can't recall his name. In this place he keeps 
a boarding house and a gambling house. 

> He has thirty barrels of whisky and he has a 
cellar rented right up next to the store at .... East 
Thirty-Ninth St. where he keeps the wine. He 
sells this wine to the men that go there. The 
whisky he keeps in the kitchen in the closets and 
other places. 

> He was arrested and put under bail once before for keeping this speakeasy, but that doesn't 
seem to bother him at all. When you go there do 
not let him bulldoze you about this place. I know 
what is going on, as I am a married woman with 
five children and he takes my husband away from 
home so as to go there and gamble his pay and 
drink. 

> So I made up my mind that this had to stop, as 
\[p.204\] 
I can hardly afford to buy a piece of bread for my 
children. He sells wine and whisky from morning 
till night. . .[^204-1]

[^204-1]: See *New York Times,* June 1, 1930. 

This is not an unusual situation under the present regime. It is exactly the condition that Prohibition was intended to prevent, but by extreme 
indirection. Of the 168 men on the New York 
Prohibition Administrator's force, the great 
majority are at work trying to stop large scale 
operations in liquor, some of which is destined to 
be used without damaging any innocent parties, 
and some of which is going into "joints" such as 
the one described in this letter. What direct remedy does this poor woman have? The administrator turns a photostat copy of her complaint over to 
the New York City police. The police department 
returns it to him without comment, and takes no 
action. His eight investigators may ultimately be 
able to spare enough time from other work to make 
this investigation. They may arrest the owner 
and his partner once more, and put him "under 
bail," but there will still be doubt whether it "will 
\[p.205\] 
seem to bother him at all." If they jail him, seize 
his liquor and close the speakeasy, the complainant's husband will have no difficulty in finding another speakeasy in the same block. To remedy this 
grievance by the Prohibition method you must 
dry up New York, and even then you are giving 
the sufferer no indemnity for her wrongs. Prohibition is a policy of all or nothing. 

If liquor control legislation had developed along 
the line of responsible drinking, this woman could 
appeal to some legal aid society, or make an arrangement with a lawyer, even a shyster or an 
ambulance chaser, and then, on the facts as given 
above, obtain from the owner of the speakeasy, or 
his partner, or the proprietor of the premises upon 
which it is situated, or as a last resort from the 
indemnity fund of the New York liquor industry, 
enough money to buy bread for her five children 
for a year. 

Incredibly, the Prohibition leaders have never 
sought to organize effective relief on the litigation 
level. The slur which Emmet McBride cast upon 
his brother, F. Scott McBride of the Anti-Saloon 
\[p.206\] 
League, "He has no lively conscience against the 
evils of the liquor traffic and *little heart interest 
for those who suffer from drink*,"[^206-1] characterizes 
the[^206-2] result if not[^206-1] the intention, of the Prohibition 
policy itself. The policy reaches out toward distant and obscure objectives, not being concerned 
with the objects which are more immediate and 
clearer. It seeks to remedy indirect and far-fetched evils, and leaves the direct, individual 
grievances without a remedy. This fact accounts 
for the exasperation of those who complain, seemingly against their real interests as drinkers, that 
they object to Prohibition because it doesn't prohibit. Neither the grievances of the moderate 
drinkers nor of the sufferers from intemperance 
are allayed by the Prohibition system. Under 
the system of the moderate 
drinkers would be satisfied at once, and those injured by liquor would be able to obtain a focussing 
of attention upon their interests and adequate indemnities for their injuries. \[p.207\]

### Reforming the Prohibitionist. 

Responsible drinking, by its sheer directness and 
simplicity, offers a prospect of ending the immediate evils of drink. This is the *sine qua non* of any adequate liquor policy. The failure to 
meet this requirement condemns alike National 
Prohibition and the anti-Prohibition policies 
which are opposed to it. But would the elimination of the direct evils of drink end the Prohibition 
agitation? Is the Dry movement sufficiently a 
product of reason that it can be expected to die 
down when its reasonable demands are met? If 
it has enough psychological momentum it can run 
on without the impulsion of a serious grievance 
against liquor. The passions inherited from its 
own history may be sufficient to stimulate it from 
within even when no open saloons stand at the 
street corners to stimulate it from without. It may 
continue to incite agitation over phrases and 
slogans even when the phrases have become hollow 
and the slogans out of date. There are some as\[p.208\]pects of the Prohibition movement which must be 
explained and controlled psychologically rather 
than logically. The existence of the movement 
is a psychological fact, to be taken into account 
quite independently of the just grievances out of 
which it arose. Therefore, a liquor control scheme 
which would end liquor agitation and put the 
whole question on the shelf must do more than 
reform the drinker and the dealer; it must reform 
the prohibitionist as well. 

What is meant by reforming a Prohibitionist? 
Merely to cause him to drink is not to reform him. 
It is plausibly asserted that many prohibitionists 
are already clandestine drinkers. The attempt to 
bring them to change their public profession would 
only stir up needless and bitter opposition. Equally 
vain would be the attempt to bring them to assume 
a broad attitude of tolerance. It is just as hard to 
get the Prohibitionist to imitate the tolerance of 
Jesus as it is to get the moderate drinkers to imitate the self-sacrificing abstinence of St. Paul. The 
true attitude of tolerance is something in the fibre 
\[p.209\] 
of a personality that is not easily counterfeited 
under the pressure of persuasion. To reform the 
Prohibitionists is not to annihilate them; their 
characteristic antipathy and intolerance may remain with them. But this attitude may be 
redirected, and the corresponding energies rechanneled, so that they are more constructively 
engaged than at present. It is one of the curious 
qualities of the scheme of that 
it invites this redirection of the psychic force of 
Prohibitionism by offering to the anti-liquor campaigners important and remunerative posts in the 
liquor control scheme. 

For there is room in the system of responsible 
drinking for strong anti-liquor associations which 
will make it their business to help sufferers from 
drink in litigation against the liquor industry. 
Such associations might well be exempted from the 
law of barretry and permitted to solicit business. 
The connection of the organization with the government might continue to be no less intimate than 
it is at present, but with this difference: whereas 
\[p.210\] 
the Anti-Saloon League at present spends its time 
bedeviling legislators, and tries to control the government, in the future it would spend its time 
attacking actual wrongdoers, and trying to serve 
the government. The organized anti-liquor forces 
should be invited to aid in the drive to make the 
liquor industry pay every cent of its debts. The 
resulting disposition of forces would be in harmony with present tendencies in government, would 
be helpful to those who are most in need of help, 
and attractive to those who must be attracted 
away from Prohibition campaigning if the liquor 
controversy is to be ended. 

The place of a special protective association in 
the field of liquor control is marked out for it by 
the general development of the so-called functional organization of society, which tends to replace the omni-competent local or territorial community with a whole array of specialized associations. These groups into which are organized men 
of like mind or like interest over the whole national area appear in our political life not only 
\[p.211\] 
as the sources of pressure in lobbying, and in the 
making of rules or setting of standards which have 
within the association the force of law, but also 
as the commissioned enforcers of one or another 
part of the general legal system. The Society for 
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Watch 
and Ward Society, the American Civil Liberties 
Union, are conspicuous instances of a type of organization which is becoming more and more common in government. The modern police force is 
itself highly specialized, with its traffic squad, 
which cooperates with the Automobile Association, 
and its homicide squad, which cooperates with the 
gangsters. It would not greatly strain our imagination to picture a regime in which the duty of 
preserving and enforcing the whole legal system 
of the country would be divided on the basis of 
interests rather than on a local and territorial 
basis. 

This type of activity could be made irresistibly 
attractive to the paid personnel of the Anti-Saloon 
and Prohibition organizations. It would be a 
\[p.212\] 
lucrative type of social work, involving ample opportunities for entering into the affairs of other 
people, and for inducing others to adopt one's own 
standard of conduct. The administration of 
drinking permits would make it possible for the 
Anti-Liquor Organization to invoke directly 
against city drunkards the kind of individual surveillance which under present conditions is effective 
only in the small towns. The law controlling the 
dealers would be enforced, like most civil laws, at 
the expense of the dealers themselves. The consequent contact with a definite source of income of 
this character would not appear to the professional agitators as a drawback, but might even 
seem to be an advantage. 

While the anti-liquor group would be able to 
strike much more effectively than at present at 
noxious uses of liquor, it would have a benign as 
well as a grim aspect. For, as a part of its ordinary routine of business, it would be a Lady 
Bountiful. It would dispense charity at the expense of its enemy, the liquor industry, thus win\[p.213\]ning friends with subsidies taken from its foes. 
In the charity system of the modern city it would 
fill a long-felt want: it would be the only charitable organization which would prefer the undeserving to the deserving poor. Wives such as 
those who under the present system can appeal 
only to have speakeasies closed could then obtain 
tangible and adequate protection for their rights. 
By the time the Prohibition movement had lost 
those of its members who were concerned about 
the real, and not the fanciful evils of drink, and 
had then suffered the further loss of those who 
would be drawn into the new type of liquor control work, there would not be enough membership 
left to maintain a significant agitation. Prohibition, with its reasonable followers converted away 
from it, and its prejudiced followers diverted to 
another use of their passions, would be no more 
effective a disturbing factor in the political system 
than vegetarianism of today. 

It is not unreasonable to look forward to an 
equally significant redirection of energy on the 
\[p.214\] 
part of the drinker. The moderate drinkers have 
great responsibilities which they will be in a position to fulfil only when the crude protection of the 
right to drink no longer occupies the forefront of 
their thought. There are accessible in contemporary America many elements which can be combined to give liquor a place of beauty and dignity 
in American civilization, comparable to that which 
wine holds in the better circles of French society. 
The avoidance of inebriety -- the supreme aim of 
temperance movements -- is only the beginning of 
the discipline which invites development. Never 
was there a society more sensitive than American 
society of today to leadership in matters of taste 
and form. Never was there a continent more thoroughly equipped with the apparatus of cultural 
contact -- radio, magazine, newspaper and movie. 
There is an evident yearning toward improving 
the tone of life, evidenced by the unparalleled 
college enrollment at one end of the scale, and by 
the success of snob advertising at the other. Much 
of the leadership that America receives in matters 
\[p.215\] 
of taste and art is far below the level to which the 
people are entitled by their energy and enthusiasm 
for new and good things. When we have banished 
liquor as a problem of politics, we will receive it 
back as a problem of art, a thing to be fitted to the 
ritual and rhythm of our national life. I do not 
doubt that in this enterprise adequate leadership 
will be found, and sane attitudes toward liquor 
will come to prevail.
