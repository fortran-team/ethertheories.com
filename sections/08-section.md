Legislators from Prophet Moses to Senator 
Jones have usually intended that their legislation 
should contribute toward the realization of the 
unattainable ideal of making men good. To aver 
that the law cannot contribute toward making men 
good is to assume the position known in political 
theory as "philosophical anarchism." Whoever 
is not an anarchist will agree that laws can improve 
men, at least so far as external conduct is concerned. It does not follow that any item of legislation, by the mere fact that it is enacted, will 
necessarily result in making men better. The 
law itself must be good, and excellence in a law 
requires a certain relation of harmony with the 
opinion of the people, the machinery of govern\[p.83\]ment, and the material facts to which the law is 
to be applied. 

### Harmony of Law and Opinion. 

It was once the dream of the romantic democrats 
of the French Revolution that they could so contrive a government that under it no legislation 
could come into existence unless it were in harmony with the opinion of the people. Law, under 
a perfect system of government, was to be a manifestation of the "general will," which was a very 
different thing from the "will of all" (*volunté 
génèrale* and *volunté de tous*). Rousseau, familiar 
with an environment wherein the politically articulate public was small, addicted to theoretical discussions, and full of people who were ready to 
entertain one opinion in a *salon* conversation, 
while intriguing for a contrary policy at court, 
saw very clearly that a man's opinion of what the 
country required might not coincide with his 
opinion of what his personal interests demanded. 
He had seen this small *intelligentsia* swept to 
\[p.84\] 
unanimity by vogues in thinking and talking; he 
dreamed of a perfect state in which legislation 
would result from the kind of opinion-forming 
that went on in the *salons*, where people discussed 
the welfare of the state in general terms. But the 
legislative process under democratic government 
was a disappointment; it did not proceed by the 
method of the symposium like conversation in a 
drawing room; it proceeded rather by the method 
of barter and bargain like the intriguing at an 
eighteenth century court. The legislation which 
it ground out was not a formulation of the 
*volunté génèrale*, but of the *volunté de tous*. 

We have learned by practical experience that 
legislation is seldom an expression of the will of 
the whole people, but is usually the product of the 
agitation of some interest-group. Statutes do not 
create themselves automatically out of a consensus among citizens; they are manoeuvred and 
parleyed for and pushed through the legislative 
process by the pressure of some interest that demands this particular legislation. The legisla\[p.85\]tive lobby is not an exceptional and cancerous 
growth in the political system; it is as much a part 
of the real government of the country as party 
system and patronage. 

The great bulk of legislation, like the great 
bulk of judicial business, has to do with other 
things than the expansion of criminal law. The 
laws which change private rights far outnumber 
those which strike out, as instruments of social 
policy, to effect an innovation in the behavior of 
citizens by altering the criminal code. The laws 
which change private rights are, in theory at least, 
intended to make men better. The employer's 
liability law makes employers more careful of the 
safety of their workmen; the laws defining the 
liabilities of common carriers cause the railroad 
officials to be more watchful of the interests of 
shippers and passengers than they would otherwise 
be. Even the protective tariff, in theory, is intended to make it possible for owners of industrial 
plants to continue in the socially desirable practice 
of giving employment to American labor (a benef\[p.86\]icence from which foreign competition would otherwise compel them to abstain) and to restrain the 
ill-intentioned foreigner who would wish to supply 
his commodities to the American market at a low 
price. 

The familiar pedantic theory which represents 
the legislative act as a restraint imposed by the 
citizen upon himself is very misleading. Men do 
not go about making laws for themselves; they 
make laws for each other. The interest-groups 
which press legislation upon a law-making body 
are not trying to compel themselves to do otherwise than they would wish to do. They do not 
expect to have their own habits and desires interfered with as the result of an enactment. They 
want the other people to be good. This is not 
only true of laws relating to property rights, 
which enforce themselves in the civil courts; it is 
also true of criminal legislation which depends for 
its enforcement upon the activities of police and 
prosecutors. The Chamber of Commerce secretary who pushes forward the cause of an anti-\[p.87\]syndicalist law is not legislating for himself but 
for others. The law will never apply to him because he will never be tempted to join the I. W. W. 
Similarly, the total abstainers who vote for Prohibition are not depriving themselves of anything; 
they are enacting a law which will not modify 
their own conduct at all. So definitely is this 
denial of self-government accepted as a part of 
our political system that when a man is observed 
to vote Dry and drink Wet he is not given any 
credit for trying to reform himself by legislation; 
he is not recognized as the only type of citizen 
who, with reference to liquor control, is ruling 
himself rather than someone else. If his vote 
results in an effective Dry regime, under which 
he can procure no liquor, he will have sacrificed 
something, whereas the total abstainer who votes 
with him will have sacrificed nothing. But public 
opinion gives him no credit for the sacrifice; he is 
disowned by all parties. 

The law by which the Drys try to improve the 
moral character of the Wets is not exceptional 
\[p.88\] 
in purpose. Like the law by which unionized labor 
seeks to raise the standard of behavior of the mill 
owners, or by which manufacturers endeavor to 
reform the business practices of importers, or 
farmers attempt to elevate the sense of social responsibility of grain dealers, it is an attempt to 
make somebody else be good. If the achievement 
of the liquor laws fell conspicuously below their 
intention, the fault was not in a departure from the 
usual purpose of law in trying to make men good, 
but rather that the method chosen to accomplish 
this normal legal object was not adapted to the 
end. It was adapted neither to the state of 
opinion, nor to the machinery of government, nor 
to the material facts to which it referred. 

The amount of support which a law requires 
of public opinion is not a constant quantity. Some 
unpopular laws are very effective; some laws fail 
to have their intended effect despite a great popularity. At least two factors control the necessary 
ratio between public support and effectiveness. 
If the incidence of the law is broad, that is to say, 
\[p.89\] 
if it touches many people directly, the popular 
backing must be strong; if the enforcement of the 
law depends upon the actions of public officials, 
and is not accomplished privately in lawsuits 
brought by persons whose interests the law protects, a still larger claim is made upon public 
opinion. The Prohibition law on both of these 
counts required a very heavy preponderance of 
opinion in its favor. No mere majority would 
have sufficed. It probably had a majority in 1920, 
even though the *Literary Digest* poll allows it less 
than that today, but had it ever an adequate majority? Kansas, dryest of states, gave only a 
fifty-seven per cent majority for enforcement in 
the *Digest* poll. Is this a sufficient preponderance? That such majorities are inadequate is 
apparent when the effectiveness of the Prohibition 
law is compared with the effectiveness of the law 
controlling the use of narcotics. The incidence 
of the narcotics law is small; there are comparatively few drug addicts; it could be enforced with 
less public opinion behind it than effective Prohi\[p.90\]bition would require. But actually it disposes of 
a much stronger force of opinion than Prohibition 
has ever mustered. 

The machinery of enforcement with respect to 
Prohibition makes even further demands upon 
public opinion. For this is a law which cannot 
be made effective by private enterprise, because a 
violation of the law ordinarily gives no injury to 
a third party, and seldom gives to anyone a right 
which it would be worthwhile to prosecute in 
court. It is not at all impossible that an anti-liquor law could be devised which would have a 
smaller incidence, for one might legislate against 
the use of liquor by persons who abuse it. It is 
equally possible that an anti-liquor law could be 
so drawn that it could count upon the aid of 
persons injured by liquor consumption to further 
its enforcement. Legislation, so contrived, could 
be made effective on a much narrower basis of 
public approval than the present legislation would 
require. The present legislation is simply out of 
tune with the state of public opinion. 

\[p.91\] 

### Liquor Legislation and Government Machinery.

That laws are more effective, regardless of public support, when they depend upon private enforcement, is in part a consequence of the peculiar 
nature of Anglo-Saxon administrative and judicial institutions. As Professor Esmein points 
out in his analysis of judicial procedure in criminal 
cases, there are two main approaches to the problem of controlling the criminal -- the inquisitorial 
and the accusatory. Accusatory procedure assumes that the community is merely a referee in 
a dispute between two persons, one of whom declares that he has been wronged. Inquisitorial 
procedure assumes that the state, not leaving detection and prosecution to private initiative, 
accepts this double duty as its own. Of these, the 
Anglo-Saxon represents the accusatory type of 
procedure, and the European Continental the inquisitory type. 

Accusatory procedure comes from early Teutonic law; inquisitorial procedure comes from Late 
\[p.92\] 
Roman and Church law. In accusatory procedure the injured party gathers the evidence with 
which he publicly confronts the accused before a 
jury of his peers. In inquisitory procedure public 
officials initiate the action, gather the evidence, 
and try the accused secretly before men who are 
not his peers, but specialists appointed by the 
ruler to aid in dispensing justice. In its barbarous form accusatory procedure used the ordeal, 
and inquisitory procedure used torture. Anglo-Saxon judicial institutions have borrowed from 
inquisitorial procedure the public prosecutor or 
district attorney, who is supposed to be the champion of the injured commonwealth engaged in a 
battle with an accused culprit before the judge 
as referee. Continental procedure in modern 
times has borrowed the Anglo-Saxon jury, which 
shares with the Continental judge some of the 
responsibility of coming to a decision on matters 
of fact. The measures proposed by our own Law 
Enforcement Commission to break away from jury 
trial in handling liquor cases are an acknowledg\[p.93\]ment of the lack of adaptation to our judicial institutions which characterizes the present liquor 
situation. 

The difference between the two types of procedure is paralleled in a difference between the elaborate police and detective organization maintained 
by European governments, and the primitive and 
uncoordinated police organizations of America. 
Just as some religions lend themselves better than 
others to the effective use of persuasion in influencing drinking habits, so some police systems are 
better adapted than others to the enforcement of 
criminal legislation of the type represented by 
the Prohibition law. This was illustrated in the 
measures taken in Europe and America respectively, to meet the problem of food control during 
the world war. The Europeans had their thorough system of police registration to serve as a 
starting point in food administration. They 
issued food tickets for every controlled product, 
and ran the whole enterprise as a branch of their 
normal supervisory police activity. The Ameri\[p.94\]can food control system could not depend upon the 
use of police registers, but had to be built up with 
volunteer organizations warmly supported by 
public opinion. Americans in their own country 
enjoy a freedom of movement which astonishes a 
European. There is no running down to the 
police station to register every change of address, 
no taking out of cards and permits in order to 
secure oneself the right to exist. We have the 
Prohibition law, and they have the type of police 
system best equipped to enforce it. 

The governmental machinery best suited for 
Prohibition enforcement would possess not only 
an elaborate supervisory police force, but also a 
well integrated union of Church and State. Successful dietary taboos usually depend upon a religious sanction. The Catholic Church of the 
Counter Reformation, with its system of auricular 
confession on the one hand, and its courts of the 
Inquisition on the other, was in a position to exercise an effective morals police. It enjoyed the 
fullest co-operation of the State. With its powers 
\[p.95\] 
of persuasion and punishment it could control not 
only overt behavior, but even inward attitudes. 
The Calvinist Puritans were handicapped in the 
supervision of conduct because they had given up 
one of the most effective weapons of morals police 
ever invented -- auricular confession. When the 
Methodist Board of Temperance and Morals asks 
the aid of the "secular arm," it repeats the tactics 
of the Counter-Reformation and the Inquisition, 
but without the ability to obtain their results. 
They cannot secure universal membership in their 
Church, or even effective control of the conduct 
of Church members through Church agencies. The 
Methodists would be willing to tighten their alliance with the State, but they have nothing to 
offer the State. They would be willing to increase 
the severity of the legal penalties to anything short 
of burning at the stake. But they lack the 
highly integrated organization which would make 
effective their co-operation in an inquisitorial institution. 

To obtain optimum conditions for Prohibition 
\[p.96\] 
enforcement, great and profound changes in government would have to be made. Our judicial procedure is accusatory; it should be inquisitorial. 
Our government is federal; it should be centralized. Our police system is protective and local; 
it should be supervisory and general. Our State 
is separated from the Church; it should be united 
therewith, having membership in both incumbent 
upon all. We have neither the courts, nor the 
police, nor the jails, nor the habits in matters of 
government, which would make it possible to carry 
out easily the intention of the law to transform 
bad Wets into good Drys. It is for this reason 
that the liquor laws place so great a strain upon 
our government. 

### The Liquor Laws and Natural Facts. 

Not only the state of public opinion and the 
character of the government, but even the material facts to which the law relates mark out the 
present liquor legislation as ill adapted to the 
purpose of making men good. The law is con\[p.97\]fused and uncertain because of the elusive character of the facts to which it relates. 

The Eighteenth Amendment prohibits the manufacture, transport, and sale of intoxicating beverages. Every term of this formula generates 
ambiguity and confusion because of a lack of 
harmony with the facts. The very concept of an 
"intoxicating beverage" is a legal fiction, while 
the prohibitions of transport and sale for beverage purposes are roundabout ways of controlling 
drinking itself, which by its nature tends to elude 
police supervision. 

What is an intoxicating beverage? Is a beverage to be called "intoxicating" when it does not 
actually intoxicate? The courts answer this question by taking judicial notice that certain liquids 
are "intoxicating beverages" and refuse to permit 
the introduction of evidence to show that in the 
particular case they did not actually intoxicate. 
But will liquor ever intoxicate if used in moderation? The court ruled in *Wadsworth vs. Dunnan*, 98 Alabama 610 that intoxication could re\[p.98\]suit only from the unreasonable use of liquor. 

> "Intoxication by means even of those liquors 
which the law itself recognizes as *per se* intoxicating in general acceptance, is produced by their unreasonable, inordinate, immoderate or excessive use, 
and to say that no liquor is intoxicating unless its 
moderate and reasonable use will produce inebriety 
is to declare that no liquor whatsoever is intoxicating." 

This ruling is sound. The very concept of "intoxicating beverage" implies a presumption of 
unreasonable use. The fictitiousness of this legal 
presumption is so patent that it stultifies the attempt to interpret anti-liquor laws consistently. 
An entirely different concept of intoxication -- 
"intoxication-in-fact" -- which assumes a presumption of reasonable and moderate use of liquor, is 
expounded by the Prohibition Administration in 
interpreting Section 29 of the Volstead Act, which 
permits the home manufacture of "non-intoxicating" cider and fruit juices. 

The problem of discriminating between potential and actual intoxication arose in the inter\[p.99\]pretation of Moslem law, just as it arises under 
the Eighteenth Amendment. The word of Allah, 
as spoken to the Prophet in *Surah V, 92* of the 
*Koran* is as follows: 

> "Oh, true believers, surely wine and gambling are 
an abomination of Satan, therefore avoid them, that 
you may prosper ... In those who believe and 
do good works it is no sin that they have tasted 
wine or gaming before they were forbidden." 

The material facts which derive from the nature 
of liquor were just as obstinate to the Moslems as 
to us. Was it intended in these verses to prohibit 
all wine, no matter whether it was used moderately 
or excessively? The ninth century commentators, 
Jalalu'd-din al Mahalli and Jalalu'd-din as Suyuti, interpreted the passage to mean: "Only that 
wine is forbidden which intoxicates the brain and 
affects the steadiness of the body." So also the 
Prohibition administration tries to rule that in certain cases (where home manufacture is involved) 
it will use the factual definition of intoxication, 
but in cases involving manufacture and sale it 
\[p.100\] 
will use the legal-fiction definition. But the orthodox Moslem doctrine did not accept the commentator's modification, and it does not seem that the 
privileged position of home-manufactured liquors 
is at all secure in the present Prohibition system. 

If the Eighteenth Amendment means to use 
the words "intoxicating liquors" in the legal-fiction 
sense, then it is an arbitrary act of nullification for 
the Prohibition commissioner to permit legally 
intoxicating liquors to be manufactured in the 
home. When Commissioner Doran declared, as he 
repeatedly declared, that he would not try to 
interfere with homebrewing (which is definitely 
prohibited by law) or winemaking (which is ambiguously prohibited), he was doing exactly the 
thing that President Hoover declares will cause 
"our whole system of government" to "crumble"; 
he was an official electing what laws he will enforce. 
But if the Eighteenth Amendment means only 
actual and not fictional intoxication, then the 
concept of intoxication-in-fact should be applied 
to all liquors, whether manufactured in the place 
\[p.101\] 
of consumption, or manufactured for sale. So 
interpreted, the Eighteenth Amendment creates 
no constitutional right to interfere with any beverages which are reasonably used. 

But disregarding the distinction between actual 
and fictional intoxication, some fluids are being 
prohibited by statute although no possible use, 
moderate or immoderate, could render them intoxicating. A beverage which is just over the 
one-half of one per cent limit in its alcoholic content is no more capable of causing drunkenness 
than is fresh milk. The definition was taken from 
the revenue laws, where the intent was to prevent 
tax-free manufacture of weak brews and carried 
over into the criminal law, where the intent is to 
describe a natural process of which the law takes 
cognisance. An Act of Congress can no more 
render a one per cent drink intoxicating than it 
can cause Washington weather to be cool in July. 
These are natural facts which impress themselves 
upon the liquor situation, regardless of the legal 
or social context of the policy of regulation. \[p.102\] 

The Prohibition administration thus exceeds 
the limits set by the Eighteenth Amendment on 
one hand, and nullifies the Amendment itself on 
the other. This disharmony is further accentuated when the activities of other branches of the 
government are taken into account. The Supreme 
Court, in a sweeping decision attacking the raw 
materials and equipment used in liquor manufacture, empowers the Prohibition administration to 
campaign against the dealers in bottles, corks, 
barrels and home-brewing supplies. This is 
simply carrying one step further the principle 
already invoked in the attempt to prohibit the 
serving of ginger ale and ice water to guests at 
hotels. There are prohibited not only the things 
which may intoxicate, but the things which may 
be used to produce the things which may intoxicate. The question of how the liquor is actually used, the most important question from the 
standpoint of common sense, falls beyond the 
cognisance of the law. 

But while the Supreme Court is implementing 
\[p.103\] 
the drive on the makers of liquor, the Department 
of Agriculture continues to instruct American 
citizens how to use the forbidden barrels which the ' 
Commissioner wants to seize, in making the forbidden wine which the Commissioner chooses to 
permit. And the Farm Board offers government 
money to help in financing the juice-grape farmers 
of California, who are marketing their entire 
product to wine-makers and selling the grapes and 
grape-juice publicly in carload lots all over the 
country. 

This is indeed a curious situation. The Farm 
Board offered twenty million dollars to help market the crop provided the grape growers would 
sign up 85% of their acreage under contracts 
providing for a tax on the crop, to be used for 
buying up the surplus tonnage and converting it 
into "by-products." Public-spirited citizens 
throughout the grape district cooperated in the 
drive to sign up the acreage. The last phase of 
the campaign was characterized by night riding 
and terrorism to coerce obstinate growers. One 
\[p.104\] 
man was killed and two wounded. But the drive 
succeeded. The marketing of the crop is now 
going forward under government auspices; the 
wine grape industry has been protected from ruin, 
the supply of raw material for the bootleg wine 
industry has been stabilized; the manufacture of 
grape jams (sold for winemaking) is adequately 
financed. And at the other end of the line officials 
of another branch of the government are trying 
to confiscate the barrels, bottles and corks! The 
government advances money to the man whose 
product goes into the barrels which the Supreme 
Court has empowered the enforcement officials to 
seize. 

These observations are not offered in a spirit of 
captious criticism; they are intended simply to 
show the intrinsic difficulty in applying legislation 
of the Prohibition type, which takes no account of 
the distinction between noxious and innocent uses, 
to facts as complex as those involved in the liquor 
problem. 

It is not only the difference between natural fact 
\[p.105\] 
and legal theory as to the process of intoxication 
that creates anomalies in the administration of the 
law; there is also a disharmony between the legal 
and factual character of the manufacturing process. In common usage we think of manufacturing as a process in which the ingenuity of man is 
occupied on some more or less complicated manipulation to create some new product. Such treatment is not required to cause fruit juices to ferment, but only to keep them from fermenting. 
The Department of Agriculture is aware of this 
aspect of the manufacturing problem. In the 
bulletin in which it gives disguised instruction in 
wine making it advises: "fermentation is prevented 
by keeping the temperature of the liquid below 
50 degrees F., or by adding potassium metabisulphite to the juice at the rate of 2 to 5 ounces 
per gallon." However, it admits that in "small 
scale homework it is neither advisable nor convenient to control fermentation by the cold or chemical treatment." The citizen can draw his own 
conclusions. \[p.106\] 

The wife of the ex-Prohibition Commissioner 
has been working out recipes for fresh-fruit-juice 
drinks, which she recommends as substitutes for 
liquor. A jug full of one of Mrs. Doran's fruit 
punches could violate the law overnight while its 
owner sleeps. If Clarence True Wilson served 
some of this recommended beverage to Bishop 
Cannon and Mr. McBride of the Anti-Saloon League, and then forgot to pour the 
surplus supply into the drain, the ubiquitous 
micro-organisms would soon be at work creating an alcoholic content of more than one-half of one per cent. The Prohibition administration takes cognisance of this fact by establishing 
the executive policy of refusing to enforce the 
anti-manufacturing law against those who make 
liquor in the home. The Volstead Act in Articles 
29 and 33 provides that no penalties shall attach 
to the manufacture without permit of "non-intoxicating cider and fruit juices exclusively for use in 
the home." The instructions issued by Commissioner Doran on August 6, 1929, order his agents 
\[p.107\] 
not to interfere "with such manufacture and use 
in the home, unless upon satisfactory evidence of 
the unlawful sale of such non-intoxicating cider 
or fruit juices. . . But if the cider or fruit 
juices are really "non-intoxicating," it is not 
under any circumstances unlawful to sell them. 
Clearly the law is creating a fictitious non-intoxicating home-made wine which is just as unreal a 
substance as the "intoxicating" one-half of one 
per cent near-beer (which is unlawful, even when 
made at home). The anomaly in a law which does 
not take into account the fact that home-fermented 
fruit juices may become intoxicating was glossed 
over by Commissioner Doran in the policy which 
left it to the local authorities to formulate their 
own policies of control relative to such home manufacturing. Thus the double meaning given to the 
word "intoxicating," which is interpreted sometimes to refer to an alcoholic content, and sometimes to a result of intemperate use, introduces into 
the law an elusive metaphysical uncertainty which 
was played upon by Representative Fort in his 
\[p.108\] 
defense of home manufacture, and which is solved 
in practice by administrative nullification. 

In the shifty interpretation of the Prohibition 
law the Wets and Drys find a common meeting 
ground. Fort, who ran on the Dry ticket in New 
Jersey meets La Guardia, a leader of the Wets in 
Congress. In his famous speech of February 
1930, Fort expressed his doubt whether the language of the law could be stretched to legalize 
home-made beer, but went on to advise: 

"To those who want beer and light wines I 
suggest that they forget the wish to buy, and be 
content with what they can make." 

La Guardia sends out to his constituents, enclosed with the above-quoted bulletin of the Department of Agriculture on wine making, an instruction leaflet of legal advice: 

"The beverage may be called wine or beer, but 
must not be labelled as such. . . . The question of 
the intoxicating character of the beverage is not 
determined by any fixed or arbitrary content. . . . 
the average home-made wine may be considered as 
\[p.109\] 
non-intoxicating within meaning of the law. . . . 
It cannot be given to strangers; it cannot be sold 
to friends. Even though the beverage is non-intoxicating, it loses its legal character if sold." Thus 
fiction is piled upon fiction. A liquid does not 
become intoxicating by reason of its use, nor its 
alcoholic content, but by reason of its transportation outside the home or its sale; however excellent 
the wine may be, the law will tolerate it only under 
the fictitious name of "Non-intoxicating fruit 
juice"; beer must be presumed to be a fruit juice, 
not a malt liquor. How Alice in Wonderland 
would have enjoyed it! 

The actual purpose of the law is not mentioned 
in the Constitutional Amendment or in the National Prohibition Act, except in that clause which 
provides that the provisions of the Act shall be 
interpreted liberally because the intention of the 
Act is to put an end to the drinking of liquor. 
There is no prohibition of drinking, either in the 
Constitution or in the Volstead Act, despite the 
fact that it is only in the drinking that a beverage 
\[p.110\] 
becomes intoxicating. The Supreme Court has 
ruled that a liquor buyer cannot be convicted for 
failure to register his purchase, but the question 
is still open whether he can be convicted for conspiracy to violate the law. If the legal status of 
liquor purchase is doubtful, the status of liquor 
possession is certain. It is unlawful to possess 
liquor illegally obtained. But the one act against 
which the whole machinery of legislation is 
directed, namely, the drinking of liquor, especially 
in immoderate quantity, remains the privileged act. 
which is still lawful no matter how many illegalities surround it. There are good reasons for this 
kind of indirection in the approach made by the 
liquor law toward its object. But the fact that 
such indirection is necessary should serve as a 
warning that the material with which liquor laws 
deal is not perfectly analogous to the material 
dealt with by other criminal laws. Legislation 
which must seek to accomplish its object by a combination of indirection and fiction is at a practical 
disadvantage. \[p.111\] 

If the legislators have not attempted to make 
drinking illegal, and the administrators of the law 
have given up the attempt to prevent home-brewing, in order to concentrate their attention upon 
commercial manufacture and sale, they are still 
unable to cope with the difficulties which come to 
them by virtue of the circumstances under which 
the law is violated. For every illicit sale of drink 
is a secret conspiracy between the parties engaged 
therein. The crimes of robbery, rape, murder, 
forgery -- all the crimes that are usually admitted 
as felonies -- are committed by a criminal against 
a victim. But when a bootlegger sells to a purchaser there is no victim. The crime is completed, 
and each one has done no more than to receive what 
he desired. On the other hand, police regulations, 
such as traffic rules, apply to offenders who injure no one in particular, but in these cases the 
purposes of the law are adequately met when the 
manifest and open violations are repressed. The 
fewer the witnesses to a traffic rule violation, 
the less is the significance of the violation itself. 
\[p.112\] 
The speeder in crowded traffic is guilty of much 
more reprehensible conduct than the unseen 
speeder on a lonely road, and he is more easily 
apprehended and punished for his violation. 

If the government were content to repress only 
the liquor transactions in which one party was 
a victim of the other (as in methyl alcohol poisoning cases), or where the conduct took place in 
public, or where the result of the use of liquor 
was public drunkenness, its policy of making men 
good by law would have better chances of success. 
But it does not have sufficient machinery to make 
the ferreting out of secret liquor offenses successful. The Manchu Emperors of China were able 
to give effective enforcement throughout the Empire to their edict regulating the style of hairdressing (the long queue) for their Chinese subjects because compliance or violation was openly 
and automatically manifested. But against 
opium smoking the Imperial Government was 
helpless, not only because of the resistance of 
the British opium interests, but also because 
\[p.113\] 
of the lack of an adequate inquisitorial staff. 

The standards of goodness which the liquor laws 
demand are, of course, like any legally established 
standards of behavior, set by the makers of the 
law for the governance of those who oppose the 
law. The law is sponsored by total abstainers for 
the benefit of topers. It imposes no restrictions 
which fall upon the sponsors; the sacrifices are 
made by the moderate drinkers, that is to say, 
the only people who really know the uses of liquor. 
It confers no rewards which appear to its beneficiaries as blessings; the blessings are perceived 
to be such by the sponsors of the law, the only 
people whose conduct is unaffected thereby. Thus 
A compels B to sacrifice himself for the sake of 
C. Such a three-cornered tension of interests and 
desires is sufficiently precarious to jeopardize the 
success of any law. It leaves all interests ill-defined. In the maze of inconsistencies and contradictions in the regime, the essential distinctions are 
not made. The distinction between public and 
private conduct, between conduct harmful to a 
\[p.114\] 
neighbor and conduct which does not affect a 
neighbor, and between using and abusing liquor is 
nowhere clearly drawn. 

A simpler regime, imposing a clearer standard 
of good behavior, and better adapted to the state 
of public opinion, the character of the government, and the natural facts to which it applies 
would stand a much better chance of making men 
good by law. \[p.115\]
