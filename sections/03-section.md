To the historian of the future it may appear as 
either a great tragedy or a great comedy that the 
American people at a critical moment of transition such as the present could find no subject more 
worthy of their attention than the problem of a 
liquor regime. It is a great misfortune that 
American opinion should be distracted by the 
liquor question at a moment when problems of 
foreign relations and industrial organization 
ought to be receiving the benefit of all the political wisdom at our command. It is a further misfortune that our thought on this question is governed by a legacy of emphasis on Prohibition, the 
product of a movement that has come down into 
the twentieth century with the fuzz of the 1830's 
about its ears. \[p.4\] 

The liquor controversy is a conflict between 
two hardened and self-contained dogmatic systems. The official Dry position differs from the 
official Wet position on questions of organic chemistry, dietetics, pharmacy, biology, religion, psychology, jurisprudence and political philosophy, 
as well as on the interpretation of statistics on economic conditions. The rivalry between these two 
systems, each of which is seeking with evangelical 
zeal to indoctrinate the people, now threatens to 
paralyze our most promising political enterprises 
and to handicap with the dead weight of popular 
indifference the most necessary movements of 
social reform. 

If we wake up some time to find that our social 
organization has developed a new feudalism, or 
that our bungling of foreign affairs has brought 
us to a world war, we will have to compare ourselves with those populations of the decadent 
Roman Empire which, while their civilization dissolved about them, resorted to riot and civil strife 
to prove that the Deity was *homo-usian* rather \[p.5\] 
than *homoi-usian* with Christ, or that the Divine 
and Human in Jesus were formed in one nature 
rather than in two. 

What prospect is there that the period of darkness will soon be ended and the liquor question 
brought to some kind of equilibrium in which it 
will cease to be the major political distraction of 
the country? What kind of victory by Wets or 
Drys would suffice to take the issue out of the 
forum and put it on the shelf? This is a vital 
question which partisans on both sides must 
answer, for unless they can answer it they must 
be reckoned as irresponsible agitators rather than 
as statesmen. 

If a neutral observer, unpledged to the doctrinal system of either camp, analyzes the program of the Drys and the numerous programs 
of the Wets, he finds that none of them can meet 
this elementary test. Both parties are fighting 
for the adoption of policies the consequences of 
which they have not thought through to the end. 
Both sides are the helpless victims of a legacy 
\[p.6\] 
of error. The Prohibition program was not a 
product of enlightened statecraft, not a careful 
adaptation of means to end, like, for example, 
the Federal Reserve System. It was a program 
defined by a greatest common denominator of enthusiasm and a least common multiple of intelligence in the American housewife and the American 
clergyman, neither of whom was trained in the 
social sciences. The generation which formulated 
the liquor question as an issue in criminal law was 
not cognizant of the real intricacy of the problem 
of social control to which it addressed itself. And 
the issue formulated in this haphazard way determined not only the attitude of the Drys but that 
of the Wets as well. 

The Prohibition issue is a legacy handed down 
to us through four generations of earnest American agitators. If you would see the social atmosphere in which the issue took form, go to Tocqueville's great essay on *Democracy in America*, 
where one of the keenest minds of the nineteenth 
century analyzes the United States of the 1830's. 
\[p.7\] 
"No sooner do you set foot upon American ground 
than you are stunned by a kind of tumult; a confused clamour is heard on every side; and a thousand simultaneous voices demand the satisfaction 
of their social wants. Everything is in motion 
around you; here the people of one quarter of 
a town are met to decide upon the building of a 
church; a little further, the delegates of a district 
are posting to the town in order to consult upon 
some local improvements; in another place the 
farmers quit their ploughs to deliberate upon the 
project of a road or a public school. Meetings 
are called for the sole purpose of declaring their 
disapprobation of the conduct of the government; 
whilst in other assemblies, citizens salute the 
authorities of the day as the fathers of their 
country. Societies are formed which regard drunkenness as the principal cause of the evils of the 
state, and solemnly bind themselves to give an 
example of temperance ... *If an American 
were condemned to confine his activity to his own 
affairs, he would be robbed of one-half of his* 
\[p.8\]
*existence;* he would feel an immense void in the 
life which he is accustomed to lead, and his 
wretchedness would be unbearable." 

Tocqueville noted, further, the tendency of this 
nation of busybodies to turn constantly to the 
legislature for new laws on all subjects: "A single 
glance at the archives of the different States convinces me that the activity of the legislator never 
slackens." And he recognized the danger to the 
future in a state of things in which the majority 
had such unlimited power that "no obstacles exist 
which can impede or even retard its progress, so 
as to make it heed the complaints of those whom 
it crushes upon its path." He observed, moreover, 
that the majority "claims the right, not only of 
making the laws, but of breaking the laws it has 
made." 

> "I said one day to an inhabitant of Pennsylvania: 
'Be so good as to explain to me how it happens, 
that in a State founded by Quakers, and celebrated 
for its toleration free Blacks are not allowed to 
exercise civil rights. They pay taxes. Is it not fair 
that they should vote?' \[p.9\] 

> "'You insult us,' replied my informant, 'if you 
imagine that our legislators have committed so gross 
an act of injustice and intolerance.' 

> "'Then the Blacks possess the right of voting in 
this country?' 

> "'Without doubt.' 

> "'How comes it, then, that at the polling booth, 
this morning, I did not perceive a single Negro in 
the meeting?' 

> "'It is not the fault of the law; the Negroes 
have an undisputed right of voting; but they voluntarily abstain from making their appearance.' 

> "'A very pretty piece of modesty on their part!' 
rejoined I. 

> "'Why, the truth is, they are not disinclined to 
vote, but they are afraid of being maltreated; in 
this country, the law is sometimes unable to maintain its authority, without the support of the majority. But in this case, the majority entertains very 
strong prejudices against the Blacks, and the 
magistrates are unable to protect them in the exercise of their legal rights.'" 

This was in 1831. We did not need to wait for 
the Civil War and the Fifteenth Amendment in 
order to initiate the policy of nullifying by administration what we had done in legislation. The \[p.10\] 
whole machine of agitation, legislation and nullification was set up and running in Tocqueville's 
time, and the prohibition platform was some of 
the grist of its grinding. 

That the program of liquor control formulated 
in the era 1830-1840 should be suited to the 
America of 1930-1940 is not intrinsically more 
probable than that Jackson's policy toward the 
National Bank would afford a model for our present treatment of problems of stock-market speculation and farm relief. The liquor program was 
stated in the beginning with a certain hyperbole 
of diction, a preoccupation with biblical illustrations and criminal law analogies which were inevitable in the 1830's, but are out of step with contemporary ways of thought. The sermons preached 
on the subject ninety years ago do not betray 
their date. Here is an example: 

> "The distiller, wholesale and retail dealers, know 
that they are engaged in a body and soul destroying business, and are virtually ruining their fellow 
creatures by wholesale: the beam cries out against 
the timber, and the stone against the wall. ... \[p.11\] 

> "I can hardly let moderation be known when I 
reflect upon this subject. What! License men to 
deal in liquid fire? *Alcohol?* That is destroying 
*thirty thousand men,* made in the image of God, 
every year. 

> "With equally as much propriety, might they 
license men to furnish themselves with daggers, to 
thrust into the heart of every man who they suppose may be possessed of a four-pence-half-penny. 

> "The only apology that can be made for licensing 
men to sell intoxicating drinks, is, that the law, 
regulating the sale, was formed at a time, when 
the community thought they were useful as a drink, 
at least when moderately used. But thank God, 
that day has passed by, and the community, not only 
sees the subject, as trees walking, but clearly; and 
instead of aiming, only to bark up the tree of intemperance, and to crop off its branches, they are 
aiming at the root, and if they persevere they will 
destroy the root with all its branches." 

This sermon, preached in 1811, might equally 
well have been preached in 1918. Were it not 
for the antiquated punctuation which inserts more 
commas than a modern stylebook would permit, 
one might well take it as an excerpt from a recent 
\[p.12\] 
speech on the subject. All the principal elements 
of the doctrine of Prohibition were present a century ago, and have not changed materially since 
that time.

Строка с ПОПОЙ
These clergymen of the 1830's had a grievance 
against the liquor industry, which their habits of 
thought did not permit them to formulate in any 
other way than as a demand that liquor-selling be 
made a crime. They were familiar with no juridical technique for limiting the exercise of property rights; they had such confirmed respect for 
absolute rights in private property that nothing 
less than criminality seemed to them an adequate 
cause for invading the prerogative of the individual to buy, to sell, to own and to possess whatever he would. The idea of peculiar kinds of 
property invested with a public interest and subject to public control was not taught to the people 
till the age of railway and monopoly politics of 
the last quarter of the century. Even the kind of 
attack on absolute property rights which an employer's liability law contains, in that it compels 
\[p.13\] 
an employer to pay for something not his fault, 
was strange to this generation. If there was something about the liquor industry which distinguished it from other enterprises, the good clergy-men could only assume that it must be a criminal 
trait, to be illustrated by the analogy of the 
assassin licensed by law to use a dagger. Modern 
social science could easily provide more illuminating parallels to illustrate the relation of the 
liquor industry to society. But the problem was 
not set up as a problem in social science until long 
after the preachers had dictated what the answer 
must be. 

The intellectual equipment of the age which 
formulated the Prohibition platform was deficient 
not only on the side of the social sciences; its knowledge of the natural sciences was also far inferior 
to our own. The doctrine that drinking is harmful 
even in moderation entered the theology of Prohibition at a time when medical science was still 
permitting blood-letting as a cure for fever and 
sending consumptives to kill themselves by a 
\[p.14\] 
regime of starvation and violent exercise. The 
official Prohibition view of the effect of alcohol 
on the human body was thoroughly articulated 
before Liebig had founded the science of organic 
chemistry, and before there was either a theory 
of cell structure or a technique for the study of 
metabolism. With respect to pedagogy, the dictum "spare the rod and spoil the child" was orthodox doctrine when the Prohibition crusade began. 
A century of intellectual progress which altered 
and expanded our knowledge of alcohol, human 
nature, and society did not alter in the slightest the 
program that was already being preached when de 
Tocqueville visited these strange shores. 

It is possible that the Prohibitionists of 1840, 
with supernatural prescience, hit upon the one 
best liquor policy for their great-great-grandchildren to adopt. But the question of the aptness 
of the solution in modern life is difficult to discuss 
because the debate now runs in a rut worn with a 
century of dubious assertion and reply. The new 
facts as they have come to our knowledge, the 
\[p.15\] 
new conditions as they have made themselves felt, 
have been given their place in both arguments. 
The automobile is held to make Prohibition at 
once more necessary and less enforceable; the 
new psychology affords to the Wets new reasons 
for regarding the moderate use of liquor as desirable, and to the Drys a new basis for doubting 
whether such a thing as "self-control" can be 
trusted to prevent harmful excess. 

All the proposals now actually before the public, 
whether they emanate from Wet or Dry sources, 
are formed either positively or negatively by the 
Prohibition model. You may have either Prohibition or a substitute for Prohibition; take your 
choice! What you cannot have is a policy or attitude toward liquor, freely thought out on the basis 
of contemporary knowledge and present-day facts, 
unprejudiced by a legacy of emphasis upon this 
one particular device which our good forefathers 
thought would solve the liquor problem. This is 
what they must mean who say that Prohibition is 
not a policy but a predicament. \[p.16\] 

Were it only possible to clear the ground and 
attack the whole problem afresh, who knows what 
the result would be? Surely it must be possible 
to formulate some attitude toward liquor upon 
which the people of America would be more likely 
to reach contented agreement than on either the 
Prohibition or anti-Prohibition proposals now before the country. For it does not appear that 
either the Wets or the Drys are at present 
equipped with a liquor program which will bring 
an end to the agitation, quiet the turmoil, and 
permit the country to devote its attention to more 
important things. \[p.17\]
