If the balance of forces between Wets and 
Drys is such that the Drys control legislation, 
but cannot capture administration, the result 
which automatically follows is the nullification of 
the law. This, as was noted by de Tocqueville in 
1830, was a standard American practice when 
the Prohibition program was formulated. There 
is some evidence that the legislator has often acted 
in matters of liquor legislation with the *arrière 
pensée* that the blow of a severe law will be 
softened by laxness of administration. 

The experience through which the country is 
now passing has called attention to the phenomenon of the nullification of law, and given currency 
to the aphorism that disrespect for one law leads 
\[p.34\] 
to contempt for all. This aphorism is equally 
useful to the Drys, who argue that unrepealable 
laws should be enforced, and to the Wets, who 
argue that unenforceable laws should be repealed. 
It was given expression in President Hoover's 
inaugural address: 

> "Our whole system of self-government will 
crumble either if the officials elect what laws they 
will enforce or the citizens elect what laws they 
will obey. The worst evil of disregard for some 
laws is that it destroys respect for all law." 

On the other side of the argument there is a 
body of opinion which looks to nullification to accomplish the solution of the Prohibition problem. 
One party fears nullification as a menace to government; the other party welcomes it as a device 
for ending the agitation of the liquor problem. 
But there is good evidence that both views are 
ill-founded; that nullification, far from being a 
menace to our system of government, is actually a 
part thereof; and that the Prohibition question, 
far from being solved by nullification, will only 
be aggravated thereby. \[p.35\] 

### Nullification, as Part of the Legal Process 

The theory that self-government is doomed 
when officers and citizens decide which laws are 
to be enforced is based upon a discredited view 
of free government: the doctrine of the separation of powers. This doctrine is a relic of 
eighteenth-century rationalism. It originated in 
Montesquieu's misunderstanding of the government of England. It has no roots in our history, 
but only in a foreigner's misconception of our 
institutions. It was a fashionable political dogma 
at the time the American Constitution was drawn 
up, but it was not then, and is not now, realized 
in the actual working of local government in 
Anglo-Saxon countries. And in these the local 
government takes care of most of the enforcement of criminal law. 

According to the theory of the separation of 
powers, people can be assured of self-government 
only when their officials enforce blindly whatever 
laws their legislatures enact. There is no short 
\[p.36\] 
circuit allowed from people to administration. 
The popular will must be expressed through the 
legislature or not at all. 

If this bookish doctrine were true, the only 
units of population that could make their will felt 
in public affairs would be those that happened 
to have sovereign legislative bodies. The smaller 
units, which take care of the enforcing of the law, 
would have only as much room for choice as the 
sovereign specifically allowed them. The law expressed by the legislature would be the "command 
of the sovereign," and aside from specific delegations of powers, there would be no elasticity or 
local variation in carrying out the sovereign's 
commands. 

But the government that lives outside of books 
takes its course without much regard for the metaphysical thing called sovereignty or the precious 
distinction between legislation and enforcement. 

Everyone knows that in American politics law-enforcement policies are openly voted upon in 
municipal elections. If the party that advocates 
\[p.37\] 
strict law enforcement is defeated at the polls, 
those who are elected to office have a mandate 
from the voters to nullify certain of the laws 
enacted by the sovereign legislative authority. 
This control of the policy to be followed by local 
officials is an inherent part of the total legal and 
political process. 

Prosecuting officials are equally sensitive to 
local pressure. In Kansas City, they obtain convictions in one-third of one per cent of the cases 
of arrest for liquor-law violation; in the rural 
districts nearby, they convict twenty-five per cent 
of the persons arrested. The judges in one region 
sentence a Prohibition offender as if his crime 
were as serious as forgery; elsewhere they treat 
him like a careless motorist. All this goes on 
openly, the judges announcing in advance what 
punishments they will inflict. And back of all 
these permanent officials, there are the temporary 
instruments of enforcement, the members of the 
juries and grand juries. If they refuse to indict 
and convict, enforcement is impossible. The 
\[p.38\] 
command of the sovereign goes unheeded. 

From the standpoint of the abstract doctrine 
of the separation of powers, this margin of local 
freedom is no doubt a deplorable anomaly. From 
the point of view of the doctrine of sovereignty, 
it is an inexcusable usurpation. But, actually, 
these practices conform to the great tradition of 
Anglo-Saxon self-government. Through all the 
changes that have marked the political path of 
the Anglo-Saxons from the tribal period to the 
present, local independence in applying criminal 
laws has prevailed. 

In the early Anglo-Saxon times each community defined its own law. The king administered justice in a limited class of cases, but it 
was the local law that governed these cases. By 
the law of Berkshire a murderer forfeited life 
and substance; by the law of Urchenfeld he was 
fined one hundred and twenty shillings. At Lewes 
the crime of rape was compounded for eight shillings fourpence; in Worcestershire it could not 
be compounded. When, in a later century, Henry 
\[p.39\] 
II sent his justices through the land they would 
inform themselves of the law of the locality, and 
would base their decisions upon the information 
they received. Later the royal judges built up a 
system of law that was common to the whole 
realm; this was the Common Law of England. 
But local autonomy was not thereby extinguished; 
from autonomy in defining the law it passed over 
to autonomy in enforcing it. 

In the days of Queen Elizabeth law enforcement was in the hands of the country gentry. From 
this class were recruited the Justices of the Peace, 
"full of wise saws and modern instances." Shakespeare knew the type. They enforced as much or 
as little of the law as they saw fit. If they happened to be strict Calvinists they might even 
go beyond the law in trying to force the people 
of their districts to conform to the Calvinist virtues. They would fine the villagers for shooting 
at the butts on Sunday. The good Queen would 
write letters of protest, but she had no way of 
compelling uniform law enforcement. The local 
\[p.40\] 
authorities simply nullified the laws that did not 
please them. This willingness to nullify law came 
to America in the Mayflower. 

In colonial times the Navigation Acts were 
unenforceable in America, the region for which 
they were intended. Smuggling ranked with other 
commercial enterprises as an eminently respectable, as well as profitable, occupation. Public 
opinion sided with the smuggler. Attempts to enforce the law broke down because the local government authorities held the key positions. This story 
has been repeated again and again in the history 
of our country. Tocqueville saw the system in 
operation in 1831. As it was with the Fugitive 
Slave Law in the North before the Civil War, so is 
it with the Fifteenth Amendment in the South 
since Hayes' administration. 

The autonomy of local government in matters 
of criminal law has not only survived the change 
from a law-defining to a law-enforcing function; 
it has also weathered the transition from the old 
Anglo-Saxon system to Norman feudalism, from 
\[p.41\] 
feudalism to squirearchy, and thence to modern 
popular government with its organized party 
politics. In the light of this historical perspective 
it would appear that the only state wherein local 
nullification menaces self-government is the one 
that exists in university classrooms alone. Local 
discretion in enforcing laws is more clearly a part 
of our system of self-government than the doctrines of the separation of powers and of sovereignty, in whose names it is condemned. 

From the doctrinaire point of view one might 
still argue that these local variations are to be 
regarded merely as violations. This raises the 
question of the distinction between nullification 
and violation. What is the law, after all, and 
how can it cease to be law? If in the state of 
New Jersey the law against larceny is violated, 
and at the same time the Prohibition law, or Sunday theatre law, is disregarded, the doctrinaire 
will lump all of these offenses together as law-breaking. In assuming this attitude he deliberately ignores all the elements of the legal situa\[p.42\]tion except the formal facts of statutory 
enactment. 

For the doctrinaire, though he may not know 
it, believes in the Austinian theory of law. That 
is to say, he thinks of the law as the command of a 
sovereign, and of the sovereign as a determinate 
organ of the state. The Austinian theory patterns a general definition of law upon the model 
of the most recent and superficial kind of law -- 
the statute. 

As against the Austinian conception, there is 
the view that law is a product of the internal 
development of the community, a function of its 
culture in which the essential element is consensus, not command. According to this more 
natural and general view the statutory enactment is only one among many ways in which law 
is expressed and defined. 

The history of law, not only in Germanic lands, 
but in all places whose legal history is known, 
shows that the earliest law was based on custom, 
and was thought to be something that no human 
\[p.43\] 
agency could alter. The legal system was kept 
up to date by forgetting old laws and remembering new ones into existence. There was no sovereign, no determinate organ, no command. 

The invention of writing interfered with this 
automatic legal system by making it more difficult to forget old laws or unconsciously introduce 
new ones. When the law was once written down 
innovations became conscious. Outright legislation came to be practised. The consequent revolution in our way of thinking has gone so far that 
we now look to new law to accomplish just those 
miracles of beneficence that our ancestors expected 
of the "good and ancient customs of the realm." 
While our legislatures grind out volume after 
volume of new laws, we continue to exclaim of 
this or that inconvenience, "there ought to be 
a law about it." 

The invention of legislation, however, has not 
killed the original habit of forgetting an inapplicable law and developing a new consensus as to 
what is right or wrong. These processes still form 
\[p.44\] 
a part of the living legal system. There are whole 
classes of unrepealed statutes which are so obviously obsolete that any attempt to enforce them 
is regarded as freakish. A grand jury in Elizabeth, New Jersey, refused to indict a theatre 
owner who was clearly guilty of violating the 
Sunday closing law, on the ground that "a change 
in conditions and customs makes the present law 
governing the moral life on the Sabbath more or 
less obsolete." 

The doctrinaire view of law breaks down when 
confronted by three important kinds of statutes. 
Some are obsolete; others are opposed by the consensus of opinion in certain communities within 
the jurisdiction of the legislature which enacted 
them; and others are enacted without intention 
on the part of the legislators that they are to be 
enforced. With laws of these three kinds the problem of nullification arises. And in each case the 
Austinian doctrinaire would claim that the statute is the law; while the student of the practical 
workings of our jurisprudence would ask whether 
\[p.45\] 
the statute is actually expressive of the existing 
law. 

To identify nullification with violation of the 
law is artificial from the standpoint of jurisprudence; from the standpoint of psychology, it is 
absurd. The statutes that are nullified by obsolescence, local opposition, or lack of serious legislative intent are not confused in the minds of 
citizens with the living body of the law. If the 
community is regularly and wilfully disregarding 
a law, the most casual conversation of the citizens 
reveals that the particular statute is distinguished 
from, not confused with, other elements of the 
legal system. 

With statutes of this type there is no evidence 
that disrespect for law is transferable from one 
law to another. The mountaineer who shoots deer 
out of season does not drop into hog-stealing, nor 
does the average citizen who carries a hip-flask 
condone such offenses as arson, highway robbery 
or rape. In fact, if the provisions of the penal 
code relating to these offenses were repealed, the 
\[p.46\] 
citizens would continue to regard them as crimes, 
and would probably devise extra-legal means of 
preventing them. 

The violence that characterizes the bootlegger's 
trade does not arise from a moral indifference 
leading the bootlegger to confuse in his mind the 
crime of murder and the crime of transporting 
alcoholic beverages. The violence results merely 
from the failure of the government to protect an 
industry that is outlawed by statute. The industry reverts to primitive self-help to protect property rights that cannot be defended in the courts 
or guaranteed by the police. It was not against 
the police that the gangsters armed themselves 
and developed their iron code. Their organization gives a rough and bloody substitute for law 
in a region from which the law has withdrawn. 

The Prohibition statute did more than create 
a new class of crimes; it abolished an old one. It 
made it illegal to sell, but practically unpunishable to steal, the forbidden liquor. The informal 
organization of the community then made com\[p.47\]pensation for the vagaries of the statute. Liquor 
larceny is still resisted and visited with punishment, though not by the police; the sale of liquor 
is still permitted, though not by the legislature. 
The speakeasies of New York often have signs 
tacked up behind the bar: "This place is insured 
against theft and dishonesty." 

Just as the Volstead Act legalizes deeds that 
the community continues to regard as theft, so 
the Jones Act sanctions deeds that the moral sense 
of the citizens continues to condemn as murder. 
By increasing the penalty for liquor-law violations, the Jones Law automatically puts the suspected liquor-law violator into the class of the 
suspected felon. An officer who witnesses the commission of the felony of transporting liquor -- if 
only in a hip-flask -- acquires at once the technical 
rights over the person of the offender that would 
be acquired by an officer who witnessed a burglary. 
If the felon flees, refusing to halt when called 
upon to do so in the name of the law, the officer 
may kill him. The law will describe the deed as 
\[p.48\] 
justifiable or excusable homicide. It may happen 
that the victim flees because he wrongly believes 
the pursuing officer to be a thug. Even this circumstance may not make the homicide a crime. 
But such acts, though legalized by statute, will 
be resented by the community as if there were 
no statute. A community terrorized by repeated 
outrages of this kind would probably develop such 
a temper that juries would acquit persons who 
killed Prohibition-enforcement officers, or the offending officials might be subjected directly to 
mob vengeance. Fortunately, the adjustment of 
law enforcement to public sentiment takes place 
by way of the autonomy of the local community, 
and nullification of the statute. The legislature 
cannot really give effect to its formal act to 
legalize murder, any more than it can make effective its enactment to legalize theft. 

Judge Louis Fitzhenry, of Peoria, Ill., contributed to clear thinking on this problem when he 
declared on November 22, 1929, that "anyone 
knowing of a friend, relative or neighbor possess\[p.49\]ing liquor in violation of the Jones law," unless 
he reports his knowledge to the proper authorities, 
is himself a felon under a statute of 1790 which 
makes a felon out of anyone failing to report a 
felony. Certain distinguished Drys, notably Senator Sheppard and Dr. Clarence True Wilson, 
were reported to be "enthusiastic" about Judge 
Fitzhenry's discovery. But it is a discovery which 
reduces the doctrinaire view of the criminal law to 
an absurdity. Imagine a corps of officials who 
should try to carry out President Hoover's advice 
by punishing all felons, indiscriminately, whether 
their felonies were defined by the Jones Law or the 
law of 1790! A fantasy, of course, but an instructive fantasy. Such action would tend much 
more to the destruction of our system of government than to its maintenance. 

This experience with Prohibition seems to demonstrate that there is something in the nature of 
law that a log-rolling legislature cannot touch by 
means of a statutory enactment. But the doctrinaire will still bring forth the objection that if 
\[p.50\] 
everyone chooses which laws he will obey, the 
consequence is anarchy. 

This is another of the objections based upon 
fiction -- in this case, a fictitious notion of human 
nature. For human beings are not rational atoms, 
each utterly independent of the other and capable 
of entertaining any view, believing any doctrine, 
upholding any cause, that a speculative mind 
might invent for him. The opinions of men cannot be plucked up arbitrarily from their deep 
background. The same resistance that is offered 
to an unconsidered legislative act will also check 
these supposed attempts towards an anarchistic 
choice of laws to be obeyed or ignored. 

The problem of law enforcement is so serious 
that we cannot afford to let our thought upon it 
derive from discredited doctrines of politics and 
law, or from fictitious notions of human nature. 
The claim that disregard of one law induces contempt for all is misleading both as to the nature 
of law and the facts of human behavior. Just as 
the logicians of Galileo's day argued that there 
\[p.51\] 
could be no mountains on the moon since the moon 
was a heavenly body, the heavenly bodies were 
perfect, and the form of perfection was a sphere, 
so the contemporary doctrinaire contends that 
there is no such thing as justifiable nullification, 
since the law is what is enacted by the legislature, 
the legislature is the voice of the sovereign, and 
the sovereign cannot be guilty of self-contradiction. 

No wise or practical policy is likely to arise 
from a theory that does not take account of justifiable nullification as an inherent feature of the 
total legal and political process. But on the other 
hand, it does not appear that nullification is a 
practical and efficient way of ending the controversy over liquor policy. 

### Why Nullification Will Not End the Controversy 

For there are special reasons, operative in the 
case of Prohibition, which render it unlikely that 
nullification will bring the liquor question to 
\[p.52\] 
equilibrium. For nullification quiets a question 
only when the dominant political authorities are 
all of one mind with regard to it. This is the way 
the nullification of the Fifteenth Amendment is 
carried on in the South today. It was the way the 
Negroes were deprived of their franchise in Pennsylvania a hundred years ago. But in most parts 
of the United States nullification will not put an 
end to Prohibition agitation because the Wets and 
Drys are not sufficiently segregated from each 
other. There are cities and states in which Wet 
sentiment is overwhelmingly preponderant, and 
in these nullification has a chance of ending controversy so far as local politics is concerned. But 
most communities contain a mixed population. 
This much, at least, was proved by the *Literary 
Digest* poll. 

To solve the liquor problem by nullification is 
therefore not unlike trying to solve the nationalities problem by drawing new boundaries. No 
frontier can be drawn that will put all the Hungarians on one side, all the Rumanians on the 
\[p.53\] 
other. Only the drastic measure used after the 
Greco-Turkish War -- the exchange of populations -- would render nullification a satisfactory 
solution. If the Wets should be segregated in 
certain states, and the Drys in others, there would 
result a situation in which the Eighteenth Amendment in the Wet state could be treated as the 
Fifteenth Amendment has been in the South. 

We have also in prospect a kind of nullification 
which will exempt certain social classes from the 
operation of the law, while requiring other classes 
to obey it. Country clubs often have good bars 
though the nearby villages be dry. The liquor 
laws of the South are both in practice and intention directed against consumption of liquor by 
Negroes, not whites. Had it not been for the 
Fifteenth Amendment, the South would have 
passed laws making it a crime to sell liquor to 
a Negro, as it is a crime under Federal law to 
sell it to an Indian living on a reservation. Out 
of formal respect for the Fifteenth Amendment, 
the legislation had to take the form of general 
\[p.54\] 
Prohibition, although it was intended that enforcement would discriminate between whites and 
blacks. Thus the Fifteenth Amendment helped 
to bring on the Eighteenth Amendment, and the 
gulf between legislation and administration of 
law was made wider. 

This type of nullification, which was expounded 
by Senator Blease when he declared that his constituents expected him to vote Dry and drink Wet, 
and that he would do as they expected, is practicable only in places where the privileged class 
is in complete control of the machinery of government. Elsewhere it encounters obstacles similar to those which face regional nullification. 
Agitators will protest and bring it about that the 
clubs of the wealthy are raided and the cellars of 
the country estates are searched. The interception of supplies destined for the poor will embarrass the bootleggers who are catering to the 
rich. The kind of class rule which would permit 
discriminatory nullification is unstable save in 
the South. \[p.55\]
