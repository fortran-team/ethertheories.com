In American social thought legislation and education appear rightly as coequal instruments of 
social policy, each of which disposes of an army 
of servants, each of which can be manipulated to 
serve one or another cause. Great as is our faith 
in the efficacy of legislation, our belief in the 
virtue of education is even greater. The word has 
become a charm word. We expect of education 
such prodigies of beneficence as men expected of 
the Goddess Fortuna in the third century A. D., 
and of the Virgin Mary in the thirteenth. The 
investment we are making in educational establishments beggars by comparison the most extravagant endowment ever showered upon a cult. It 
would be strange, indeed, if we did not appeal to 
\[p.68\] 
education to end the liquor schism, since we appeal 
to it for everything else in the register of social 
improvement. There is a certain sound reason 
for the faith in education, for if we could get all 
people to think and behave alike where liquor is 
concerned, the schism would be ended. And education is indeed the only instrument capable of 
producing such unanimity. 

Yet a fact so obvious that it is usually neglected 
must be kept in mind: education, like legislation, 
is a method rather than a solution, a tactic rather 
than a goal. To cry "education" without specifying the doctrine which is to be taught is as 
meaningless as to cry for legislation without specifying the character of laws which it is desired to 
enact. 

Is there a system of ideas with which the whole 
country is willing to have itself indoctrinated? 
Is there a code of behavior with respect to liquor 
which has the approval of all? The Drys call for 
total abstinence, the Wets for temperance. Thus 
the two systems of ideas which in the plane of 
\[p.69\] 
legislation confront each other as "Prohibition" 
and "modification" are still found confronting 
each other on the plane of education, with their 
stock of catch-words complete, and their arguments substantiated with testimony drawn from 
a score of sciences and pseudo-sciences. 

As between "abstinence" and "temperance" 
there is no unanimously accepted preference. 
Neither the scientists nor the clerics -- the two 
groups who hold authority in matters of thought 
as the legislators hold it in matters of law -- are in 
agreement on this issue. The fact that certain 
churches are predominantly Dry and others predominantly Wet leads one to suspect that in the 
liquor controversy we have to do with proselyting 
by one cult for the observance of its dietary 
taboo. The Baptists and Methodists entertain 
toward liquor an attitude not unlike that of the 
Jew toward pork or the Roman Catholic toward 
the eating of meat on Friday. The fact that the 
testimony of scientists is cited both for and against 
the moderate use of liquor leads us to doubt the 
\[p.70\] 
finality of the appeal to "Science." For the facts 
which are pertinent to the dispute do not all fall 
within the competence of any science, nor are they 
subject to the control or the discipline of any one 
branch of learning. These pertinent facts are to 
be found strung all along from physiology to 
aesthetics, from sociology to ethics. Between abstinence and temperance there is an issue which 
no existing tribunal of thought -- moral thought 
or scientific thought -- is competent to decide for 
the American people. 

Yet there must be some postulates which are 
acceptable to all, to Wets and Drys alike. We 
do not know what they are, but *they are worth 
looking for, for they are the necessary starting 
point of any policy in education or legislation 
which will solve the liquor question*. 

There must be some system of views about the 
use of liquor, some ethical standard, of which the 
Wets could say, "So much we admit," and the 
Drys would reply, "It is not enough, but so far 
as it goes, it is true." \[p.71\] 

If the point of unanimity could be found, it 
would be wise to concentrate attention upon the 
devising of a liquor regime which would be most 
favorable to the realization of this minimum ideal. 
The resources of pedagogy and advertising could 
then be called upon to propagate effectively, 
without stirring up counter-currents to undo their 
work, a doctrine corresponding to this ideal. 

Thus an examination of the potentialities of 
education as a device for solving the liquor problem leads to the question of a minimum ethic of 
drinking. There has been no systematic inquiry 
to determine whether there is an ethical standard 
so widely acceptable that only the crank and 
freak would deny that it is valid at least as far 
as it goes. Lacking a clear statement of the minimum objective, the arguments of Wets and Drys 
take on that kind of confusion which comes upon 
social thinking when means and ends are confounded with each other. Prohibition is sometimes presented as a means whereof the abolition 
of intemperance is the end, and at other times it 
\[p.72\] 
is set forth as an end in itself. The Wets sometimes reproach Prohibition with having caused 
an increase in the use of liquor, thus implying 
that they prefer a regime in which a minimum 
amount of liquor is consumed. The evidence of 
the confusion is apparent in those phrases which 
have become part of the small change of conversation: "Prohibition is all right but it doesn't 
prohibit," "I'm against Prohibition, but I don't 
want to see the saloon back." There may be in 
the mind of the American people the materials 
for a far wider consensus of opinion on the use 
of liquor than the present formulation of the 
issue reveals. Let us then attempt to classify, not 
attitudes toward Prohibition, but attitudes toward 
liquor. 

The old Teutonic tradition brings to us an attitude toward liquor expressed in the words "drinking bout." In accordance with this tradition men 
compete with each other in capacity, and compete 
also against the liquor itself as an opponent. The 
man of small capacity, who quickly loses his head, 
\[p.73\] 
or whose stomach is quickly turned by drinking, 
is regarded as a weakling, and is properly to be 
despised. The large amount of liquor consumed 
by a man or a party of men is a proper subject 
of boasting. Drunkenness is a social duty imposed upon all who join in a drinking bout, but 
the strong man does not yield too quickly to the 
liquor. He proves his strength by the quantity 
and strength of the liquor he can drink before 
he goes under. So the Gods drank in the old 
Norse mythology. And have we not those among 
us who will boast of a row of gin bottles as Thor 
boasted of the size of his drinking horn? 

There is a less boisterous and a merrier tradition which suggests the sunshine of Italy rather 
than the mist of England, or a shady terrace 
rather than a smoke-filled hall. In this tradition 
wine is not the opponent to be vanquished but 
a means to be used in the art of social intercourse. 
Drinking has as its object the achievement of a 
state of mind which will be pleasant and profitable to those who share it. The virtue of the occa\[p.74\]sion is to be sought in the excellence of the wine 
and the brightness of the conversation which flows 
from it. The ceremonial of drinking is developed 
toward refined forms which retain no trace of the 
competition of drinkers against each other or of 
each drinker against the wine. The art of judging wines is highly developed; it becomes a science, 
with a Greek name -- *oenology*. The art of mixing 
drinks corresponds, for the users of distilled 
liquors, to the art of judging wines. Everywhere 
the aesthetic side of drinking is brought to the 
fore, and the offering and accepting of liquor is 
fixed as a part of the ritual of hospitality. 

More humble but just as deeply rooted as the 
ceremonial and artistic attitude toward liquors 
is that which looks upon them as the normal parts 
of a standard diet. "*Pas de pinard, pas de poilu*" 
-- no wine, no soldiers -- was a slogan of the French 
army in the World War. This attitude enters 
the arena of the present liquor controversy in the 
phrase "wine with meals." The habit of using 
liquor as a part of the regular family meal goes 
\[p.75\] 
along with certain kinds of cooking and certain 
standard fare. The true French or Italian cuisine breaks down completely when the food has 
to be served without wine. Nor is this true only 
of the more elaborate and delicate foods. To 
people who have certain common food habits, 
bread and cheese with wine are a dinner, while 
bread and cheese with water are no better than 
prisoners' fare. To deprive these people of liquor 
does more than merely to take away from them 
a commodity they enjoy; it disorganizes their 
whole diet. 

Another attitude toward liquor is common to 
those who have never made liquor a part of their 
routine of life, nor trained themselves to enjoy it. 
They have little to say of the use of liquor, but 
are definitely committed to the disapproval of 
the abuse thereof. With them, the use of liquor 
begins to give rise to a moral issue. They would 
say that it is an issue between temperance and 
intemperance. Like the men of the drinking bout, 
they look upon liquor as an opponent, but their 
\[p.76\] 
attitude toward this opponent is more defensive, 
rather than aggressive. The champion of the 
drinking bout drinks his beer by the tub-full and 
boasts of his capacity; the champion of temperance drinks a small glass and boasts of his restraint. 

There is also a neutral attitude held by some 
people who are total abstainers. For themselves, 
they say, they do not enjoy liquor, or their doctors forbid them to drink it, or they have never 
had an opportunity to acquire a taste for it. 
They do not regard the use of liquor, especially 
in moderation, as a wrongful act, nor do they 
look upon the liquor question as a moral issue. 
These persons are the tolerant abstainers from 
drink. 

Finally, there is the attitude of those to whom 
liquor is a cult taboo. With religious earnestness they deplore the evil that is latent in the 
smallest of glasses of the mildest of intoxicants. 
So intense is their hatred of drink that they are 
angered by the thought that anyone should use 
\[p.77\] 
any liquor whatsoever. They regard liquor as 
an enemy, an opponent with whom they must 
contend; but the only victory over liquor, to their 
minds, is total abstinence. "Have courage, my 
boy, to say *No*," runs their song. In their view 
the strong man is not the man who drinks most 
liquor or the one who controls himself in the drinking of liquor, but rather the man who refuses to 
drink at all. 

We have distinguished six degrees of opinion 
which separate the ultra-Wet from the ultra-Dry. 
They are the attitudes of those who use liquor 
for (1) a drinking bout, (2) aesthetic enjoyment 
and ceremonial, (3) habitual diet, and (4) exercise in moral restraint, as well as those who (5) 
abstain with tolerance, and (6) abstain with 
moral fervor. 

Of these six attitudes, four involve the use of 
liquor, while two call for abstention. Two of them 
accept liquor as a part of normal life, without 
giving it any special position as an antagonist 
against which man tries his strength; three of 
\[p.78\] 
them regard liquor as a competitor against which 
man strives in combat. Drunkenness in the drinking bout is a sign of courage; in connection with 
the ceremonial or aesthetic use of liquor it is a 
breach of good form or good art; in the eyes of 
the man to whom liquor is simply a part of the 
regular meal, it is a reprehensible wastefulness; 
to the temperance advocate it is a sign of weakness, and to the moralistic total abstainer it is the 
deadliest of the deadly sins. 

Certainly this list of six attitudes does not exhaust the number of possible attitudes toward 
liquor, nor even the number of attitudes actually 
held among the American people. But the list is 
long enough to indicate the difficulty that would 
confront anyone who would seek to draw up an 
educational program which would bring the 
country to unanimity on the liquor question. 
Which of these attitudes should be selected as the 
basis of teaching if education is to solve the liquor 
question? The antithesis of temperance versus 
abstinence remains. \[p.79\] 

However, there is no reason for giving up the 
search for an ethic of drinking which would obtain 
maximum approval. (Note that we speak here of 
*an attitude toward liquor*, not a political policy 
or regime.) We can only make guesses in trying 
to define this standard, but even guesses on this 
question are worth making. As a guess, which 
is subject to correction as soon as research shall 
have uncovered more facts in this connection, it 
is suggested that these four following propositions 
define opinions which most of the drinkers would 
agree to, and which most of the abstainers admit 
to be true, even though insufficient: 

1. That a temperate use of liquor is better than 
an intemperate use. 

2. That education and training should discourage 
the intemperate use of liquor. 

3. That a disproportionate part of a man's income 
should not be spent for liquor. 

4. That when liquor is drunk under conditions or 
in quantities that bring injury to some person 
other than the drinker, the injured person has 
just cause of complaint. \[p.80\] 

Probably a few of the roisterers of the drinking 
bout would deny these propositions, saying that 
they believed in drunkenness, and a few of the 
most fanatical of the total abstainers would denounce them because they seem to offer approval 
of moderate drinking, even though the approval 
is expressed only in relative terms. But there is 
no doubt that these general propositions concerning liquor come far nearer to having the unanimous approval of the country than does any 
specific measure of liquor legislation or policy 
before the American people. 

If the country could in some way identify and 
define that attitude toward liquor upon which 
there is the nearest thing to unanimity, it would 
be in the possession of the key to the solution of 
the liquor problem. And if a serious attempt were 
then made, in the light of contemporary knowledge of educational and advertising technique, 
and of law and administration, to devise a regime 
which would best realize the ideal implied in this 
attitude, there would be a good chance of finding 
\[p.81\] 
a remedy which would quiet the agitation of the 
liquor question. The starting point in devising 
a liquor regime should be something upon which 
the country is agreed, and not a pair of opposed 
prejudices with a hundred years of controversy 
behind them, or a program which the exigencies 
of political warfare have transformed from a mere 
means-to-an-end into an end-in-itself. \[p.82\]
