It is related that when Adam was leaving the 
Garden of Eden he was heard to mumble to himself, "It is nobody's business what I eat or drink." 
Whether his complaint against the jealous proprietor of Eden was a just one must be left for 
theologians to discuss; certainly his sentiment finds 
an echo on many lips today. Whatever system of 
liquor control we may adopt, we can rightly require of it that it make clear to the man whose 
freedom it restricts the exact nature of the interests for the sake of which his wishes are sacrificed. And a regime which would distinguish the 
qualified drinkers from the unqualified, the legitimate uses of liquor from the illegitimate, must be 
based upon clear principles of policy determining 
\[p.116\] 
when the public is and when it is not concerned 
with what a man eats or drinks. How are a man's 
own affairs to be identified as such? What is 
meant by "minding one's own business?" When 
and where and why does an action become illegitimate meddling? 

When de Tocqueville made the keen observation 
that an American, "condemned to confine his activities to his own affairs would be robbed of one-half of his existence," the doctrine prevailed in 
the French world of thought that there was an 
absolute distinction imposed by a Law of Nature, 
forever setting apart those things which are the 
concern of the individual from those which may 
legitimately constitute a preoccupation for his 
neighbors. Tocqueville would hardly have believed what every student of society accepts today 
as fundamental: that society itself decides what 
affairs are one's own business. There are some 
societies which, in fear of pestilence, concern themselves with a man's piety but not with his sewage; 
other societies, driven by the same fear, supervise 
\[p.117\] 
the garbage disposal of every household, but pay 
no attention to its manner of worship. In all fields 
of interest and activity -- sex, food, work, sleep, 
art, entertainment -- there are zones wherein 
society does not accurately define the extent of the 
community's interest or the individual's freedom. 
No absolute and eternal standard distinguishes 
private from public affairs, nor separates the business of one individual from that of another. And 
even the standards of social intervention set by a 
community are often vague and full of inconsistencies. 

A society lives by doing incompletely two contradictory things: imposing a common standard 
upon all, and requiring a special contribution from 
each of its members. The ideal of law and the 
ideal of specialization or division of labor are 
respectively realized by making 
society more uniform and by making[^117-1] 
it more varied. 
From this situation two ethical principles emerge. 
With respect to the ideal of uniformity it is good 
that every individual should conform to the laws, 
customs and standards; with respect to the ideal of 
\[p.118\] 
division of labor it is good that all people should 
"mind their own business," and refrain from interfering in the affairs of others. The more definitely fields of responsibility are marked out, the 
more completely is labor divided. In every society, 
from Plato's Republic to the United States of 
America, there is some point of equilibrium between the claims of these two principles. 

[^117-1]: \[The words "society more uniform and by making" are a handwritten insertion, probably in RCB's hand.\]

The principle of division of labor applies 
primarily to the production of material things; 
the principle of uniformity is primarily effective 
on the mental level. A man's food is his own and 
does him good only to the extent that he appropriates it to himself; his talk, on the contrary, is 
shared with his neighbor and is of value to him 
only to the degree that it is shared. Property is 
the primal pattern of the principle of seclusion, 
as language is the primal expression of the principle of conformity. The seclusion of the individual, his specialization in his own field, his 
separateness from the rest, is greatest in property 
matters and least in matters of gossip and talk. 
\[p.119\] 
Property rights could perhaps be defined as the 
amount of exclusiveness which a society will permit an individual with respect to material things. 
The principle of uniformity, manifesting itself in 
gossip, opinion, moral precept or law, tends always to override the exclusiveness of the individual. 
When in describing some human relationship we 
wish to emphasize the exclusiveness of the man 
standing against the crowd, we tend to use the 
property concept as a metaphor applying to his 
situation. We say that the man was "minding his 
own business," and the other was "interfering with 
someone's affairs." 

But the question of minding one's own business 
does not always arise on the same level. Meddling 
can take the form of discussion, exhortation, of 
litigation or prosecution. The lowest level of 
interference is that of gossip and curiosity; above 
that level there is the kind of persuasive intervention of which the typical example is the evangelical enterprise of spreading a religion. Still 
more definite is the kind of intervention in which 
\[p.120\] 
one man interferes with another in order to protect what he regards as his own rights. The typical example of interfering with another's business 
upon this level is the lawsuit in defense of a property right. Every creditor who sues a debtor is 
interfering with the debtor's business, but public 
opinion does not reproach him for so doing. The 
highest level of intervention is that which is undertaken by the police officers of the state in the enforcement of criminal law. We can imagine a 
man whose drinking in one community would be 
an object of gossip; in another it would give rise 
to attempts to persuade him to alter his habits; 
in another it would cause his wife to sue him for 
divorce and separate maintenance; and finally in 
some communities he would be arrested for unlawful possession of liquor. At which point would it 
be said that there begins an unjustified interference 
with his freedom to eat and drink as he pleases? 

Under what circumstances will he recognize 
the neighborhood's right to talk about him, but 
not to exhort him, to exhort him but not to sue 
\[p.121\] 
him, to sue him but not to have him arrested? 

On the level of gossip there are very few things 
in which Americans protect themselves from intervention. There are some things, such as sex in 
marriage, which are, in the opinions of many, 
properly to be exempted from interference even 
on the level of curiosity. They are not to be 
talked about. In some circles it is considered very 
rude to ask how much money one makes, or how 
much something has cost; elsewhere these are accepted topics of conversation. As to eating and 
drinking, most people do not restrain their curiosity. They discuss their neighbor's doings. They 
do not think it indiscreet to ask each other what 
there was to drink at So and So's party; they 
criticize bad cooking and bad liquor, and no one 
resents their idle comment. 

On the level of exhortation the American is 
much more sensitive. Both the Wets and the Drys 
regard the evangelism of the other party as a 
grievance to themselves. The resentment of the 
drinker urged by some preacher to sign the pledge 
\[p.122\] 
was a familiar source of comedy until the temperance campaign was dropped in 1918. The temperance campaigners themselves always condemned 
the illicit persuasiveness of saloon-keepers and 
boon companions. Under the regime of the Volstead Act there continued unabated a kind of inverted prohibitionism enforced in some places by 
group opinions. There are circles in which it is 
required that a host shall provide liquor for his 
guests. The penalty for disobedience is qualified 
social ostracism. The late comer at a party is 
expected to "catch up" with the rest. In many 
groups the broad tolerance which still recognizes 
the right of a guest to refrain from drinking is 
rare indeed. Where the right to persuade in favor 
of liquor is so widely acknowledged, it is illogical 
to deny the right to exhort against liquor. Let 
the drinker have strength of mind to resist signing the pledge; let the hero of the temperance 
song have courage to say No. 

So long as the people who concern themselves 
with the drinking habits of others remain on the 
\[p.123\] 
level of curiosity or evangelism, their activities 
may give rise to resentment, but create no serious 
social problem. 

Though the legitimacy of the gossip and gospel 
types of interference in other people's affairs be 
recognized quite generally throughout the country, it does not follow that activities on these levels 
are everywhere equally effective. The small town 
is everywhere the unit in which curiosity and gossip 
play a large part in life; the great city offers its 
people an anonymity which shields them from 
criticism. The nomadic city-dweller, who migrates 
every year from one apartment house to another 
exactly like it, does not know his neighbors well 
enough to criticize them effectively, even if he were 
inclined to do so. Apartment-house gazing in 
cities -- the indoor sport of watching the windows 
of nearby apartments -- takes its special character from the anonymity of city life. In a village 
there is also a habit of watching one's neighbor 
from behind half-drawn blinds, but with a totally 
different object, because in village life one views 
\[p.124\] 
every act of a neighbor as part of a biography; 
in apartment-house life the incidents one notices in 
a neighbor's life are mere isolated pictures. 

Because of the anonymity of city relationships, 
the evangelical type of intervention in the lives 
of others is also particularly ineffective in cities. 
To live in a great city is in fact to live a double 
life. Under normal circumstances the working 
environment and the living quarters are two different worlds. It is almost impossible to hold anyone steadily under the influence of exhortation. 
Those who seek to exert their influence on their 
neighbors under city conditions therefore resort 
to the mechanical devices of advertising campaigns 
and newspaper publicity enterprises, in which an 
impersonal surface speaks to an anonymous crowd. 
Under these conditions persuasion tends to affect 
only those who are already persuaded; there is 
no concentration of homiletic energy upon those 
who stand most in need of it. And this is exactly 
the reverse of the situation obtaining in the village. \[p.125\] 

Persuasion in influencing drinking habits, 
therefore, is effective to a degree inversely proportionate to the density and concentration of 
population. It also diminishes in efficiency as 
one passes from a culture area which we can call 
Middle Western (although it is spread over many 
other areas) to a culture area which can be designated as Eastern (although not all of the eastern 
section of the country participates in it.) The 
difference between these two cultures is so marked 
that the good citizen of Iowa or Kansas who goes 
to an eastern community will often feel as if he 
were in a foreign land. The cool urbanity of the 
Easterner irritates him. Conversely, some sales 
managers say that they cannot successfully entrust middle western territory to eastern men. 
What is the difference between these two cultures? 

The middle western culture is built upon a substratum of rough, warm Methodism which urges 
upon people the primitive communal duties of 
doing good to one's neighbor, and aiding the neighborhood enterprise. The fund of energy and social 
\[p.126\] 
habit that was once drawn upon to bring together 
a quilting-party, a corn-husking or a log-rolling 
gathering is still available. It is used in the 
W. C. T. U. The Middle Westerner's sincerity in 
wishing to do good is equalled only by his awkwardness in doing it. The Easterner has a different spirit. He feeds his soul upon the leavings 
of an intellectual Unitarianism, a snobbish Anglicanism, or a frigid Puritanism, and none of these 
nourishes in him any hot zeal to improve his fellow-men. Wherever this Eastern culture predominates, the effectiveness of persuasion is low. 
The individual thinks of conduct in terms of 
"breeding," which is not transferred to anyone by 
a hortatory technique. The women prefer the 
D. A. R. to the W. C. T. U. There is a tendency 
for this Eastern type of culture to take possession 
of great cities, for the Middle Western type to 
linger longest in the small towns. 

These two cultures are coming to hate and to 
fear each other. Never was the conflict more 
clearly demonstrated than in the last Presidential 
\[p.127\] 
election, in which Al Smith was cartooned to the 
Middle West as a city slicker, while Hoover was 
depicted as an honest farm boy who had made 
good. It is noteworthy that Prohibition has been 
most successful in the small Middle Western towns, 
that is, in precisely those areas where interference 
by means of discussion and exhortation are most 
effective, and least successful in the large Eastern 
cities, that is, in the areas which depend for social 
control upon litigation and prosecution. 

The urban community, far more free from 
informal meddling by neighbors, is much more 
subject to police regulation than the small town. 
It is here that litigation flourishes. Whereas in a 
small town a lawsuit between two citizens over 
damages in an auto accident is a matter of public 
scandal, in a city it is a matter of course. The 
fire laws, housing laws, traffic regulations and 
licensing regulations have in the city a complexity 
and volume which the small town can avoid. It is 
often argued in connection with the problem of 
liquor control that modern life is requiring more 
\[p.128\] 
and more public regulation, and this is especially 
true of modern urban life. But it is noteworthy 
that liquor regulation has been most successful 
in the places where police regulation in general is 
least used, and where the police equipment is 
smallest. This fact leads one to question whether 
the penal laws have ever been the really effective 
agencies of liquor control, and whether the successes in reducing liquor consumption claimed for 
Prohibition are not actually a residual result of 
work once done on the persuasion level for temperance and abstinence. For on this level we are 
ready to admit that others may concern themselves with what we eat and drink. 

Upon that level of human relationships where 
separateness is most highly consecrated, that is to 
say, on the level exemplified by the property right, 
it is usually easy to determine whether a given 
thing is or is not "any of my business." One can 
go to law about it. Every lawsuit is really a test 
whether a certain matter is or is not any of the 
plaintiff's business. The whole legal machine of 
\[p.129\] 
a modern state is occupied principally with the 
heavy task of marking out the limits which separate one citizen's business from another's. 

Even a communistic regime must set definite 
spheres of responsibility and authority, and must 
define the relations of individuals to things and to 
each other in such a way that people know which 
actions are one's business and which are not. In 
a communistic state, or in a great organization of 
slaves, or in an army, these distinctions are likely 
to be even more rigid and definite than in a society 
which makes use of our more familiar property 
concept. The fact that the economics of division 
of labor requires specialized responsibility, so that 
each man shall have his own affair to occupy him, 
and none shall take it upon himself to meddle in 
the other's affair, is illustrated in any hierarchy 
or any organization. The Russian peasant on one 
of the newly established communal farms can say 
to a peasant on another farm, "It's none of your 
business how we do our planting," but he cannot 
say this to one of the members of his own *com*\[p.130\]*muna*. But if in the course of the day one task is 
assigned to him and another task to his fellow-member, he can legitimately resent interference 
by the latter, and say to the meddler, "Mind your 
own business." The Soviet Government itself 
through its lawcourts or administrative officials 
must in the last instance be able to decide when the 
protest against the meddler is justified, and when 
it is not. In the same way an army court-martial 
will inquire whether such-and-such an officer was 
acting in line of duty when he gave such-and-such 
an order -- was he in fact "minding his own business" or not? 

If civil law in a modern state is the instrument 
for defining the limits of an individual's business, 
criminal law is chiefly important as a supplement 
to civil law. This fact is attested not only by the 
enormously greater volume of business that comes 
to the courts under the civil code, but also by the 
history of the law itself. The early Germanic laws 
from which our legal system is derived were principally devoted to the protection of private rights, 
\[p.131\] 
and were in fact privately enforced. The idea 
that the criminal had harmed the whole community 
was familiar only in connection with crimes of impiety and cowardice in war. If a murder was committed, the earliest legal result was that the relatives of the slain had the right to retaliate upon 
the relatives of the slayer. Then the community 
intervened by supervising a private transaction 
in which the offending family paid a *wergeld* to 
the kinsmen of the murdered man. The law which 
regards the murderer as an offender against the 
State, whom the forgiveness of the kinsmen of his 
victim cannot clear of the consequences of his 
crime, is a much more recent development. The 
old law still lingers on in the form of the right to 
damages which the dependents of a murdered man 
can make good against the murderer. The sections of the penal code which relate to thefts and 
frauds are even more directly based upon the prior 
existence of property rights defensible by private 
lawsuit. 

The same thing is true with regard to auto
\[p.132\] 
mobile legislation. In the use of our highway system the reckless driver, the man driving on the 
wrong side of the road, the man who cuts in on 
another, is denounced by everyone on the road. 
He cannot successfully defend himself by saying 
that it is nobody's business how he drives his car. 
The line between what is his business and what is 
his neighbor's business has been drawn. The problem of how much freedom he has in using a vehicle 
on the highway has been threshed out in hundreds 
of thousands of damage suits. The other drivers 
on the road have rights which they can defend in 
court if any harm comes to them. And the police 
official supplements the work of the civil courts 
by interfering with those who overstep the limit 
already established. In the development of our 
institutions of social control the natural process 
requires that individual responsibility and freedom be first defined by civil law, and later given 
additional protection by the criminal law. In general people are more reluctant to accord a right of 
interference to a police officer than to a private 
\[p.133\] 
person who has been specifically wronged. Therefore, it might be expected that only in cases where 
a drinker had already acknowledged the right of 
injured persons to sue because of him would he 
concede the right of the police to interfere with 
him. 

If we turn, then, to seek on the level where 
rights are analogous to property rights for the 
limit that restricts a neighbor's right to interfere 
with a man's drinking, or a man's right to drink 
in defiance of his neighbor, an amazing fact comes 
to light. This whole area of doubt is relatively 
unexplored by the civil law. 

It is one of the most curious chapters in the 
history of liquor control that the extent and limitations of civil-law rights in drinking have never 
been adequately studied or adjudicated. The Prohibitionists did, indeed, concern themselves in the 
decision of one property-right question. It was 
decided that the owner of liquor-producing or distributing properties had no claim to compensation 
when the State destroyed their value. But the 
\[p.134\] 
whole theory of Prohibition pointed to the existence of other property rights to which no one ever 
paid sufficient attention. The prime symbol of the 
Prohibition campaign, from 1830 to 1930, has 
been the picture of the drunkard's wife. Here the 
argument against liquor was strongest. Did liquor 
control interfere with the personal liberty of the 
drinker? Yes, but it gave personal liberty to his 
wife. Without this idea in its doctrine the Prohibition movement would have died before it was 
born. Nobody knew how many dependents of 
drinkers were suffering from the bad habits of 
the husband or father; the estimates were always 
high, and there never existed any research machinery adequate to the task of checking them. 
But everyone knew that there were cases where 
liquor did this kind of damage. The anti-liquor 
movement mobilized in the defense of these injured 
parties. But it did not interest itself in their 
rights to compensation for damage suffered. It 
studied the property rights of the liquor-seller, 
and found them invalid; it studied the relation of 
\[p.135\] 
liquor-seller to the damage, and found him responsible for it; but it did not devote much thought 
to the property rights of the persons injured, or 
seriously try to enable the sufferers to collect compensation from those who were responsible. 

This was the point at which the liquor movement got off the track. This was the crisis of the 
liquor control movement, in which the narrow preoccupations of the clergy crippled it for life. The 
enemies of the saloon wanted to put into jail the 
saloon-keeper, the owners of the industry, the 
drinker -- anybody or everybody could go to jail, 
but they were not willing to begin by making the 
saloon pay for the damage it had caused. 

This neglect in developing the civil damage 
aspect of liquor control is all the more remarkable because most states provided themselves with 
civil damage laws which laid the foundation for the 
adjudication of the real injury caused by liquor. 
These civil damage laws, creating a right of action against the dispenser of liquor in favor of 
anyone injured by an intoxicated person, were 
\[p.136\] 
invented in the 'fifties, and became standard in the 
various state codes in the 'seventies. The New 
York law, passed in 1873, is a sample of the type 
of statute which should have been the starting 
point of a healthy system of liquor law. 

> Every husband, wife, child, parent, guardian, 
employer or other person who shall be injured in 
person or property or means of support, by any 
intoxicated person, or in consequence of the intoxication, habitual or otherwise, of any person, shall 
have a right of action in his or her name, against 
any person or persons who shall, by selling or giving 
away intoxicating liquors, cause the intoxication, in 
whole or in part . . .; and any person or persons 
owning or renting or permitting the occupation of 
any building or premises, and having knowledge 
that intoxicating liquors are to be sold therein, 
shall be liable, severally or jointly, with the person 
or persons selling or giving intoxicating liquors 
aforesaid, for all damages sustained, and for exemplary damages. . . . 

These laws were used. There are leading cases 
interpreting them in the law reports of half the 
states in the Union. The principle was incor\[p.137\]porated in many of these laws that a relative of 
a drunkard could serve notice on retailers, and 
after the serving of notice collect heavy damages 
for every sale. In New Hampshire the minimum 
damage the jury can award under the statute is 
one hundred and fifty dollars for each offense. 
The collection of damages under this law was 
secured by a right of recourse against property 
owners and bondsmen of the retailers. The principle was laid down by the courts that if damage 
resulted from a long spree, the whole amount of 
the damage could be collected from any one of 
the dealers who had sold liquor to the reveller, 
and it would be left for him to collect from other 
dealers who had been contributory to the same 
damage. Some of these laws were comparatively 
ineffective because they applied only to illegal 
liquor sales. There have been some awards under 
these statutes even since the passage of the Volstead Act. A Missouri case resulted in an award 
of $25,000, collected by the dependents of a man 
permanently injured by drink; a New Jersey case 
\[p.138\] 
recently resulted in the award of $12,000 where 
there was a death due to liquor. Now it argues 
strangely as to the interest which the Anti-Saloon 
League takes in matters of this kind that when 
a general complaint was raised against the use 
of poison in denaturing alcohol, the League generously offered to help dependents of persons 
killed by poison liquor by *prosecuting the bootleggers for murder*, but never, from its inception 
to the present day, has the League attempted to 
give real help to those who have suffered at the 
hands of the saloon-keeper, by sponsoring them 
in the collection of indemnities, nor even by propagating the information that these protective 
laws were on the statute books. 

Indeed, any systematic work to bolster up and 
improve these civil rights would have deflated an 
enormous amount of Prohibition argument. The 
sob story about the parent whose boy had begun 
to loiter at the tavern to the loss of his soul and 
the destruction of his body, would have provoked 
the query as to why the parent did not resort to 
\[p.139\] 
the remedy the law gave him, and make the tavern-keeper pay so heavily in damages that he would 
close his doors to boys. The Massachusetts law 
gives this right of action in favor of parents, 
and provides that the liquor-seller cannot offer 
as his defense that he did not know the buyer 
was a minor. The heart-rending tale about the 
drunken husband whose children were in need of 
food would have come to an ineffective ending if 
the conclusion had been that the wife, with the 
legal advice offered her by some Anti-Liquor 
Society, had obtained enough money from the 
saloon-keeper to buy food and clothes for the whole 
family for the year, and the saloons of the town 
had blacklisted her husband and refused him 
entrance. There are cases under the Civil Damage Laws establishing the right of the wife to 
compensation not only when the husband's drinking habits have diverted money from the family 
to the saloon, but also when the husband's ability 
to hold a job has been diminished by drinking. 
There are laws providing that when a man is in 
\[p.140\] 
jail because of crime committed under the influence of intoxicants, the seller of the liquor must 
support his family while he is in jail. Every 
branch of civil-damage legislation killed a branch 
of the argument for Prohibition. The more effective the civil-damage legislation was made, the 
less justifiable would become the indiscriminate 
interference involved in Prohibition. The development of these two liquor control programs 
were therefore alternative rather than supplementary to each other, since the success of the 
civil-damage system would preclude the possibility of obtaining the passage of a Prohibition 
law. 

Moreover, the passage of Prohibition laws defeated the purpose of civil-damage laws by 
destroying the property responsibility of the 
liquor-seller. A right of action against a bonded 
liquor-dealer, with recourse against the owner of 
his premises as well as the bondsmen, is a valuable 
right. A right of action against a bootlegger is 
usually worthless. The trend of liquor-control 
\[p.141\] 
legislation in support of the civil-damage laws 
would have been to increase the financial responsibility of the liquor business, instead of driving 
the whole industry underground. Just as the 
development of the civil-damage laws would have 
precluded the enactment of the Prohibition laws, 
so the enactment of Prohibition almost nullifies 
the application of the principle of civil damage. 

The Prohibition law itself suffers from the fact 
that civil-damage laws were not allowed to grow 
to maturity. Although the history of law, in 
everything from the law against murder, at one 
end of the scale, to traffic regulation, at the other, 
witnesses the prior establishment of limits upon 
private rights, and the subsequent entrusting of 
public authority with penal powers to cause these 
rights to be respected, nevertheless, our liquor 
legislation never passed through the right-defining stage. It is, therefore, quite natural that, 
aside from recognized rights of discussion and 
persuasion, there is no commonly-accepted view 
as to when it becomes someone else's business what 
\[p.142\] 
a man may eat or drink. And without such a 
consensus, it is quite as one might have expected 
that the law empowering police officials to enforce 
rights which are not in themselves acknowledged 
or clearly defined, would lead to endless confusion. 

The preachers and women who pushed the 
liquor-control problem directly from persuasion 
methods to criminal-law methods, without passing 
through the preparatory stage of civil-law definition of rights, were acting in an ignorance that is 
easily explained, not only by their lack of professional qualification to understand the principles involved, but also by the prejudices of the 
age in which they formulated their views. It was 
an age in which the concept of absolute property 
right as the converse of an absolute right of individual freedom ruled legal and political thinking. 
A man could get a legal education in those days 
by reading Blackstone's *Commentaries*. The problem of slavery and of liquor control both presented 
themselves to these minds in the same terms: a 
given kind of property is wicked, and must be 
\[p.143\] 
abolished, or else it is rightful and must be protected. In the history of jurisprudence the men 
of that day might have found other ways of working away from slavery than Abolition. Perhaps 
the other way would not have been equally good, 
but it was at least worth studying. They might 
have tried gradually to increase the legal rights 
of slaves, protecting their persons against corporal punishment, then giving them the right to 
acquire a personal property and protecting it by 
law, gradually limiting the right of master over 
slave until the institution was transformed through 
serfdom to freedom. The evolution of slavery in 
Roman civilization might have suggested these 
ideas to them. We are surprised, not that the 
men of that day failed to do these things, but that 
they did not even think of them, or discuss them. 
As a matter of fact, the only solutions they seriously discussed were confiscatory emancipation 
and compensated emancipation. The parallel between Abolitionism and Prohibitionism is not to 
be overdrawn, but the two are alike at least in this 
\[p.144\] 
respect, that they could draw from their age only 
a very limited supply of legal and political ideas, 
and only one idea about property: that it was 
either entirely right or entirely wrong. 

It does not appear that the civil-damage laws 
were looked upon as providing a starting point 
for liquor regulation and control. They seem 
rather to have been intended to satisfy particular 
grievances. That a liquor-control regime might 
emerge from them seems not to have occurred to 
anyone who was interested in the problem. Dr. 
Cherrington, General Secretary of the World 
League Against Alcoholism, in an address on May 
22, 1930, described the "nine principal programs 
advocated by the Drys in the interest of mitigating the evils of the beverage alcohol traffic 
during the past century." He did not mention the 
civil-damage laws among the nine. Nevertheless, 
these laws had in them the germs of all acceptable 
liquor-control systems because they made the distinction between innocent and noxious uses of 
liquor clearer, instead of obscuring it, and they 
\[p.145\] 
defined those instances in which it literally becomes another person's business what I eat or 
drink. 

In describing the circumstances under which it 
can become the concern of a third party how a 
man may eat or drink, the civil-damage laws 
begin with the most obvious and direct kinds of 
damage -- namely, damage to person, property and 
means of support. They specify certain relationships wherein damage of this kind is most likely 
to ensue, namely, those of husband to wife, parent 
to child, and employer to employee. The man 
who beats his wife when drunk or spends all his 
weekly pay check in the saloon or loses his job 
because of his drinking habits has forfeited his 
right to say that it is no one's business what he 
may choose to drink. Public opinion goes easily 
along with the civil-damage laws to this point. 
There are other situations in which the right of 
meddling in another's drinking habits is less clear. 
A case came up under the civil-damage law in 
which a farmer sued a liquor-dealer for the value 
\[p.146\] 
of a horse lost through the negligence of a drunken 
hired man. But perhaps the hired man would have 
been negligent even though sober. Are employers 
to have the right to regard themselves as damaged by any diminished efficiency in their workmen which they attribute to drink? But they have 
another remedy for such damage in the reduction 
of wages or the discharge of the offending workmen. If the workmen are docked or discharged, 
their families have a right of action for loss of 
support due to liquor. Clearly, there are borderline cases where the extent of a third person's 
interest in a transaction between a liquor-dealer 
and a drinker is ill defined. Where damage to 
"person, property or means of support" is involved, the chief difficulty is to lay down the rule 
as to just how close must be the relation between 
the drink and the damage in order to create a 
legitimate right of intervention. 

There is another type of damage suffered by 
third parties in the transaction between a seller 
and a drinker. This is the moral and psychologi\[p.147\]cal damage which appears when liquor enters as 
a factor in family disorganization. The feeling 
of a wife disgraced by her husband's habits, or 
the mental distress which accompanies family friction due to drink, or the suffering of a parent 
whose child is learning drinking habits of which 
he disapproves -- all these are acknowledged by 
enlightened opinion as very real grievances, because the family has a right to a certain moral 
solidarity. The civil-damage laws never gave very 
extensive recognition to these rights. They did 
not allow any rights to indemnity for intangible 
losses, except indirectly, in the right which parents received to sue dealers who sold to their minor 
children, and the right that lay in any member 
of a drunkard's family to protect him from temptation by serving notice against selling, and suing 
any dealers who sold, to the designated family 
member. 

This consequence of the moral solidarity of the 
family is acknowledged by public sentiment even 
where the law does not give it recognition. The 
\[p.148\] 
following notice was clipped from the *Grant 
County Press* of Petersburg, West Virginia, by 
the indefatigable editor of the *American Mercury:* 

> All Moonshiners and Liquor Handlers are hereby warned not to give or sell my father, Sam Self, 
a drop of liquor in any shape or form. All parties 
not heeding this notice will be dealt with according 
to law. 

> Jack Self. 

The private wrong which is heard in this press 
notice demanding its remedy speaks more distinctly than the criminal code, because its right 
to speak is more widely admitted. Intervention 
between buyer and seller of liquor under these 
circumstances by a member of the family involved 
is not regarded as a violation of personal liberty. 
The civil law has no difficulty in identifying these 
cases, because the connection between the drinking 
and the damage is explicit and direct. The difficulty arises rather in estimating the amount of 
the damage. 

There is also a type of property interest and 
\[p.149\] 
a type of moral interest which the community 
can claim upon ordinary principles of equity with 
regard to the drinking habits of its members. If 
a man becomes a pauper through drink, or if he 
becomes an object of police action because of 
intoxication, the community has a property interest in the matter. The civil-damage laws were not 
drawn to permit the town authorities to sue the 
liquor-dealers for the cost of maintaining pauperized drunkards, but the claim is quite within the 
logic of the principle. Intoxication in a public 
place, since it endangers the public peace, is also 
an acknowledged basis for interference by the 
community. 

When it is conceded that a man's drinking 
habits may become the business of another person 
because of damage to the material interests of any 
person or of the community, and because of injury 
to the moral interests of his own family, there is 
still another kind of interest which is asserted by 
those who answer affirmatively the question, "Am 
I my brother's keeper?" A man who has no 
\[p.150\] 
family, who cannot harm himself by drink because 
he is a total abstainer, who is not responsible for 
the welfare of any children from whose vision 
he wishes to have liquor banished, will still claim 
an interest in another man's food habits on the 
ground that liquor is harmful to mankind. It is 
not harmful to himself, for he drinks none of it; 
he has himself suffered no damage for which he 
could hold drinker or purveyor liable. If liquor 
legislation had been worked out patiently through 
the development of civil law this man would never 
have made himself a place in court. He would 
have been told that so long as his object was the 
improvement of his neighbor, not the protection 
of himself and family, the level upon which he 
should work was the level of persuasion. As things 
stand at present, we have no way of knowing what 
proportion of the forces backing Prohibition consist of people who are trying to do good to people 
who do not want to have good done to them. It is 
this kind of interest that makes Prohibition a 
"noble" experiment. If the liquor regime were 
\[p.151\] 
based upon machinery for redressing actual individual grievances, and satisfying real claims for 
personal damage, it would at once be less noble 
and more stable. 

It appears now, in our present experience, that 
the law relating to the use of liquor neglects that 
principle of specialized responsibility, of correspondence between qualifications and privileges, 
which is axiomatically applied to our productive 
economy, and which is an expression of one of the 
principles underlying the organization of society 
-- the principle of specialization or division of 
labor. This lacuna in the system of liquor control 
appeared when the transition was made directly 
from intervention on the level of persuasion to 
intervention on the level of police compulsion, 
without passing through the preparatory stage 
of defining the extent of an individual's right to 
drink, and clarifying the nature of the interests 
which a third party may claim in a transaction 
between a buyer and seller of liquor. Had the 
law passed through this stage, it would have 
\[p.152\] 
accommodated itself to the elementary fact that 
some people use liquor without abusing it, while 
others do not. The law would then have worked 
out a very definite and acceptable answer to the 
question whether, under such and such circumstances, it is anybody's business what I eat or 
drink. \[p.153\]
