Five hundred years ago, as history relates, the 
Great Schism divided the obedience of Western 
Christendom between two rival lines of Popes, 
elected by two rival colleges of Cardinals. An area 
almost as large as the United States was confronted 
by a problem which seemed almost as insoluble as 
Prohibition. It was then that there was set down in 
the University of Paris a great chest, into which 
all the masters, doctors, theologians and scriveners 
were invited to deposit their written opinions on 
ways of ending the Great Schism. Thus it is in 
accord with honorable precedent that in matters 
of great public concern men should freely toss their 
opinions into the common stock, there to be culled 
and sorted, compared and collated, till simplicity 
emerge from confusion, and light from darkness. 

Today there is need for the taking of fresh 
counsel in the matter of Prohibition. A few years 
ago we were able to hope that a little more doggedness and patience would suffice to end the liquor 
problem; today that hope is waning. Something 
\[p.viii\] 
more than doggedness is required. A few months 
ago it seemed that any attempt to think out the 
liquor problem along new lines was vain because 
of the deadlock of political forces; now that deadlock is broken, and a fresh appraisal of the situation has become imperative. The *Literary Digest* 
poll has shown that those who are dissatisfied with 
the present state of things are so numerous that if 
they were united upon a common program they 
could impose their will upon all lawmaking bodies, 
and modify the Federal Constitution itself. But 
none of the proposals now actually before the 
people seems likely to serve as a basis for such 
united action. 

In this essay the attempt is made to explore the 
field of the liquor problem while remaining uncommitted to the doctrinal system of either Wets or 
Drys. And the conclusion is suggested that the 
elements necessary for the solution of this question 
are already in existence, unperceived, in our present institutions.
