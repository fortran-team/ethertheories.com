If neither enforcement nor nullification promises to put the liquor question on the shelf, what 
can be said of the series of proposals for modification of the law now brought forward by the 
Wets? 

The proposals of the Wets fall into the following logical order. First, there is the demand that 
the liquor policy of the nation be reviewed, the 
instrument of the reconsideration being usually 
the referendum or plebiscite. Second, it is proposed that the control of liquor policy be shifted 
from the national to the state or local authorities. 
Third, it is urged that the scope of the Prohibition law be altered or definitely interpreted to 
permit manufacture, but not sale, of fermented \[p.56\] beverages -- that is to say, home brewing. Fourth, 
it is demanded that the sale as well as the manufacture of beverages be permitted, but under restriction either as to the type of beverage (light 
wines and beers) or the quality of the dealer 
(government sale, or sale by private monopoly 
under government grant). 

These measures include, in principle, all the 
proposals of modification now before the people. 
Do any of them promise to end the controversy? 
So much effort is now being spent by the Wets in 
facing the merely tactical problem of how to accomplish any modification whatsoever, that there 
is a tendency to ignore the great strategic question of devising a regime which would finally solve 
the liquor problem for all parties. Are not all 
of these measures of modification like so many 
devices for harnessing perpetual motion, so many 
devices for squaring the circle? Are there any of 
them which promise to put the liquor question to 
sleep? 

Imagine yourself dictator of America for a 
\[p.57\] 
day. Say that you had power to change any laws 
in any of the states, that you could repeal, extend 
or amend any item of Federal legislation, that 
you could alter the Constitution itself. Tactical 
difficulties in gaining votes for this or that measure would not exist for you. Could you, with 
our present budget of liquor-law proposals, put 
into the law books any scheme that the whole 
country would so far accept as to be willing to 
turn its attention to other problems? 

1\. *Referendum*. The referendum or plebiscite 
on Prohibition is, of all these projects, the most 
non-committal and indecisive. It would determine 
whether at the moment the majority of the voting 
population were Wet or Dry. But beyond that 
it would decide nothing. It is the legislative proposal least compromising to the legislator. It 
"passes the buck" to the people, but it does not 
contain the solution of any of the problems of 
liquor legislation. If it should turn out that a 
majority of the voters are Dry, the Wets will be 
deprived of one of their many arguments -- the 
\[p.58\] 
argument that Prohibition has been foisted upon 
the people by a minority. But no one is naive 
enough to believe that this will reconcile the Wets 
to the situation in which they find themselves. 
If, on the other hand, it appears that a majority 
favors the modification of the law, which of these 
proposed modifications will answer the needs of 
the time? 

2\. *Decentralization*. To give control of liquor 
policy to state or local authorities, taking it out 
of the hands of the Federal Government, would 
shift the forum of the controversy. But how 
would it change the issues? States or localities 
which are substantially unanimous for or against 
Prohibition could, in theory, enjoy a regime suited 
to their desires, undisturbed by the raucous voice 
of agitation. But, as the *Literary Digest* poll 
shows, these communities are few indeed. Not one 
of the forty-eight states is without a substantial 
minority ready to protest any decision. Only ten 
states can show even an absolute majority one 
way or the other -- five for enforcement and five 
\[p.59\] 
for repeal. To find those groups in which there 
is substantial unanimity, one would have to go 
to the local communities, and even there they would 
be few enough. But the establishment of a liquor 
regime on the authority of local communities becomes farcical because of the extreme mobility 
which the automobile gives to persons and things. 
In the enforcement of a Prohibition law, the psychological advantages of local option are balanced 
by technological disadvantages. And from the 
standpoint of the drinker neither state nor local 
option can offer him satisfaction if the majority 
of his state or locality is Dry. It makes no difference to him whether the authority that interferes with his personal habits is the state or the 
nation. Rather than emigrate from a Dry district he will prefer to agitate, and the prohibitionists will carry on a perpetual campaign to 
extend their territory by small conquests. The 
road to political peace does not lie in that direction. 

3\. *Home Brewing*. The Volstead Act and many 
\[p.60\] 
of the state Prohibition acts contain provisions 
which, under administrative interpretation, are 
held to give protection against prosecution to the 
man who makes wine or beer for use in his own 
home. This is one of the most curious points in the 
present law. The Prohibition administrators declare categorically that they will not interfere 
with home brewing, even if the product of the 
brew should have an alcoholic content higher than 
that which the law defines as intoxicating. No 
one is quite sure whether or not this administrative interpretation strains the real meaning of 
the legislation. But at least home brewing lives 
on sufferance and would be difficult to eradicate. 
But the policy of permitting manufacture, while 
condemning sale, is difficult to 
justify. If drinking is legal, why compel people 
 to confine themselves to the product of the home cellar when 
large scale production would give them something 
better and cheaper? 

Certainly there can be no expectation that the 
legalizing of home brew would quiet the agitation. 
\[p.61\] 
Home brew is practically legal at the present 
moment, and never was the uproar greater than it 
is today. 

4\. "*Light wines and beers.*" Let the experiment be made of legalizing the sale as well as the 
home manufacture of light wines and beers, either 
by changing the definition of "intoxicating beverage" or in any other way. Then the question 
will arise: Why stop with wines and beers? The 
people who are drinking gin and ginger ale, those 
who are making cocktails according to their fancy, 
will see no adequate reason for permitting one 
drink and banning another. Rum punch often 
has less alcoholic content than wine. People can 
get drunk on beer and remain sober on whiskey. 
And the man who knows the art of drinking could 
never acknowledge the logic of a law that will 
deny its sanction to so innocent a liquor as Chartreuse or Benedictine. The plea for "light wines 
and beers" is a political slogan which does not 
correspond to the real desires or habits of the 
Wets, and if the principles of it were enacted into 
\[p.62\] 
law the battle for full freedom would still go on. 

5\. *Government sale*. The proposal to permit 
sale of liquor (whether limited to wines and beers 
or not) by a public dispensary under government 
ownership has gained adherents on the very sound 
ground that it would improve the present situation, and on the very unsound ground that it 
would work in the United States as well as it 
works in Canada. The regime would be an improvement over that which obtains at present 
with respect to the fostering of crime and the 
quality and price of liquor accessible to the public. 
But in one respect it would not be an improvement; it would not take the question out of politics, and this for two reasons. We are a more 
diversified people than the Canadians, and therefore we would have the local-option kind of agitation wherein the Wets would try to extend, and 
the Drys to restrict, the area covered by the public liquor service. And, more than this, we are 
not as much as the Canadians a political people. 
Less than any other people in the world do we 
\[p.63\] 
depend upon our government to do things for 
us. If we are seeking to accomplish some object 
of public importance, the last place we go is the 
government. And our government machine is 
therefore not kept in good trim. It lacks the discipline necessary to carry on, without corruption 
or scandal, a large-scale retailing enterprise. If 
we gave the government a monopoly of toothpaste and set up a chain of public tooth-paste dispensaries, we would put tooth-paste in politics 
and have a tooth-paste scandal. How then can 
we expect to take liquor out of politics by putting 
it in? 

There is no guarantee that the alliance of bootlegger and politician would be broken; far greater 
is the probability that the same personnel in both 
camps would continue to share the same sources 
of graft. The bootlegger would become a public 
servant, and the money now collected by the politicians for protection would then be collected 
under cover of letting contracts for liquor supply. 
The superiority of the public dispensary to regu\[p.64\]lated private enterprise would be questioned by 
Drys and Wets alike, and the fact that liquor was 
being retailed by the government would keep the 
liquor question constantly on the political agenda. 

6\. *Repeal of Prohibition laws*. Let us stretch 
our imaginations further and assume that all legislation against liquor is repealed. A legalized 
liquor industry returns like Rip Van Winkle from 
the mountain. How changed is the scene! We 
cannot know with any certainty how this industry 
would organize itself, except that of one thing 
we can be sure: it would not reproduce the organization it had before its excommunication. There 
has been such a shuffling of American social conditions that the old place is no longer open for it. 
The new position which women have established 
for themselves, the chain store method of distribution, the higher wage scales and standards of 
living, the large-scale method of organizing industry in great units, the new conception of the power 
of advertising and the importance of nursing the 
public relations of an industry, the dissolution 
\[p.65\] 
of the attitude toward liquor once built up by the 
Women's Christian Temperance Union crusade, 
would all conspire to make the reproduction of 
the old situation impossible. The vested interests 
of the gangsters and bootleggers which are easily 
capable of protecting themselves against the 
police and which would rapidly take over a public 
dispensary system, would be helpless before the 
onslaught of a liquor industry with responsible 
leadership and unlimited financial resources. Revolutions such as that which replaced the movie with 
the talkie are easily accomplished when capital is 
available, and such a revolution would be expected in liquor selling if it were legalized. We 
have no way of prophesying whether the standard 
legalized liquor-selling establishment would look 
more like a tea room, an Automat, a Child's Restaurant, a night club or a brothel, but we can be 
pretty sure that it would be just about as hard 
to reestablish the old saloon in its old social context as to maintain the corner grocery in its vanishing social functions. \[p.66\] 

We do not know what form a returning liquor 
industry would take, but we are well justified in 
assuming that, as long as the Prohibition program 
continues as a fixed idea in the minds of the groups 
that have been hereditary Prohibitionists since 
1840, the agitation will go on. Though we peer 
as far as we can into the future of our liquor 
policies, we see no road that leads us out of the 
tumult and into a land of peace. Neither enforcement, nor nullification, nor modification, nor repeal, will solve the liquor question so long as Prohibition is taken as the guiding point. \[p.67\]
